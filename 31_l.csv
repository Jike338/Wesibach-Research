TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to semiconductor processing method of forming a plurality of capacitor on a substrate , bit line contact and method of forming bit line contact . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Circuit device fabricated on or over semiconductor wafer typically undergo one or more photolithographic step during formation . During such photolithographic step , device feature can be etched using conventional technique . The spacing between such device is important because often time adjacent device must be electrically isolated from one another to avoid unwanted electrical interconnection . One of the limitation on device spacing stem from limitation inherent in the photolithographic process itself . In the prior art , device are generally spaced only a close a the photolithographic limit will permit . By way of example and referring to FIGS . 1 and 2 , a semiconductor wafer fragment 25 includes a substrate 29 atop which a material 28 is provided . A plurality of patterned masking layer 26 are formed atop the material 28 . Referring to FIG . 3 , the material 28 is anisotropically etched through the patterned masking layer 26 to form line 30 atop the substrate 29 . As shown , individual line 30 have respective width L1 which constitute the minimum photolithographic feature size available for a line . Typically , a separation S1 separate adjacent line 30 across the substrate a shown . Such dimension is typically only slightly larger than L1 but could be the same a L1 . The term pitch a used herein is intended to be in it conventional usage , and is defined a the distance between one edge of a device and the corresponding same edge of the next adjacent device . Accordingly and in the illustrated example , the pitch P1 between adjacent line 30 ( i.e. , from the left illustrated edge of one line 30 to the left illustrated edge of the next immediately adjacent line 30 ) is equal to the sum of L1 and S1 . As integrated circuitry get smaller and denser , the need to reduce spacing dimension or pitch , such a S1 and P1 , becomes increasingly important . This invention grew out of the need to reduce the size of integrated circuit , and particularly the need to reduce spacing dimension and pitch between adjacent device over a semiconductor wafer . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention includes semiconductor processing method and related integrated circuitry in which a plurality of patterned device outline are formed over a semiconductor substrate . Electrically it insulative partition or spacers are then formed on at least a portion of the patterned device outline , after which a plurality of substantially identically shaped device are formed relative to the patterned device outline . Individual formed device are spaced from at least one other of the device by a distance substantially no more than a width of one of the electrically insulative spacers . According to one aspect of the invention , capacitor are formed . In one embodiment , a pair of adjacent capacitor container are formed over a substrate by etching a first capacitor container opening having at least one sidewall . An electrically insulative spacer is formed over the sidewall . A second capacitor container opening is etched selectively relative to the spacer . Capacitors are then formed in the capacitor container in a manner such that adjacent capacitor have a separation distance which is substantially no greater than the width of the spacer between the adjacent capacitor . In one aspect , a bit line contact is formed . The bit line contact is formed a an opening that extends through a layer formed on a substrate to a node on the substrate . A first dielectric sidewall is formed in the opening and coat an interior sidewall of the opening . A second dielectric sidewall is formed in the opening and coat an interior sidewall of the first dielectric layer . A conductive plug is formed within an interior sidewall of the second dielectric layer and extends through the opening to establish electrical communication to the node . A novel masking layout is provided which allows capacitor to be formed in a manner which reduces device pitch by almost 50 % . Such is particularly adaptive for use in fabrication of DRAM circuitry .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purpose of the U.S. Patent Laws to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts ( Article 1 , Section 8 ) . Referring initially to FIGS . 4 and 5 , a plurality of patterned device outline 32 are photolithographically formed over a semiconductive substrate 34 . As used herein , the term semiconductive substrate is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material , including , but not limited to , bulk semiconductive material such a a semiconductive wafer ( either alone or in assembly comprising other material thereon ) , and semiconductive material layer ( either alone or in assembly comprising other material ) . The term substrate refers to any supporting structure , including , but not limited to , the semiconductive substrate described above . In this illustrated example , the material constituting outline 32 may be of the type which can be etched selectively relative to the substrate 34 . Such outline define area over the substrate 34 in which conductive line are to be formed . Such patterned device outline are , dimension-wise , substantially the same a those set forth with regard to the patterned masking layer 26 illustrated in FIGS . 1-3 . Referring to FIG . 6 , an electrically insulative material such a SiO2 or Si3N4 is formed over the line 32 and the substrate 34 and is subsequently anisotropically etched to provide a plurality of sidewall spacers 36 on at least a portion , and possibly all , of the pattern device outline 32 . For purpose of the ongoing discussion , the patterned device outline 32 define male pattern between which female pattern 38 are also formed . Accordingly , an array of alternating male/female pattern are formed over the substrate wherein the sidewall spacers 36 are formed in the female pattern 38 . Referring to FIG . 7 , and after forming the sidewall spacers 36 , the male pattern or patterned device outline 32 are removed by suitable etching technique . The etch etches the device outline 32 relative to the material forming spacers 36 and the substrate 34 . Such leaf behind a plurality of upstanding sidewall spacers 36 which effectively define thin electrically insulative partition between which a plurality of device are to be formed . As shown , the distance or lateral spacing between adjacent spacers varies from spacer-to-spacer . According to one aspect , a plurality of space 40 a through 40 i are provided wherein adjacent space , such a 40 a and 40 b , differ slightly in lateral width dimension , while alternate space , such a 40 a and 40 c , have substantially the same lateral width dimension . Referring to FIG . 8 , a conductive material 42 is formed over the substrate 34 and the sidewall spacers 36 and may completely fill the space 40 a through 40 i . An example material for the layer 42 is conductively doped polysilicon . Referring to FIG . 9 , the conductive material 42 is etched back by suitable method such a a chemical-mechanical polish ( CMP ) or dry etching , a is known in the art . Such form a plurality of substantially identically shaped circuit device relative to the patterned device outline 32 ( FIG . 6 ) . In this embodiment , such device are conductive line 44 which are spaced laterally from one another a distance which is no greater than a width of one of the electrically insulative sidewall spacers 36 therebetween . As so formed , immediately adjacent conductive line of the plurality of line formed have a pitch P2 which is substantially no greater than a lateral line width L2 plus a width W2 of the spacer 36 which is positioned between the adjacent line . As compared to the pitch P1 ( FIG . 3 ) of the prior circuit device , pitch P2 represents a reduction in pitch which approach fifty percent . Such achieved pitch reduction are without regard to the prior art photolithographic spacing constraint imposed on semiconductor processing . As mentioned above , the spacing between adjacent spacers 36 varies from one spacer 36 to another spacer 36 . Accordingly , the pitch P2 varies a well . It is possible for the spacing between adjacent spacers 36 to be uniform , however , so that the pitch remains constant across the substrate 34 . Referring to FIG . 10 , a top plan view of the substrate 34 is shown . Conductive line 44 collectively define a series of conductive line which in turn define a device array 46 of substantially identically shaped device . The array 46 includes the plurality of upstanding spacers 36 and the conductive line 44 formed intermediate the spacers 36 . In accordance with one aspect of the invention and a described with reference to FIG . 9 above , adjacent line 44 have a pitch which is substantially no greater than about the distance between a pair of adjacent spacers 36 ( corresponding to the line width ) plus the width of the spacer 36 therebetween . In the illustrated example , conductive line 44 are elongated and adjacent conductive line 44 have different lateral line width . Additionally , alternate line 44 have substantially equal lateral line width . Such variation in line width stem from the manner in which the anisotropically etched sidewall spacers 36 are provided over the substrate 34 , and in particular the lateral spacing of device outline 32 ( FIG . 5 ) . As mentioned above , it is possible for the line width to be substantially equal over the entire substrate 34 . Referring still to FIG . 10 , a dashed line 48 traverse the device array 46 . Individual elongated conductive line 44 are formed over the substrate 34 transversely along the line 48 . Respective alternate device along the line 48 have a substantially common width dimension therealong and respective adjacent device have a different width dimension therealong . Referring collectively to FIGS . 11-18 , a semiconductor processing method of forming a plurality of alternate device on a substrate in accordance with the above-described principle is described . According to one aspect of the invention , the device comprise capacitor , and may comprise capacitor forming part of a dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) device . Circuit device other than the illustrated and described conductive line and capacitor can be fabricated in accordance with the invention . In accordance with one embodiment , a plurality of bit line contact are formed in opening etched over a substrate in one etching step , and a plurality of capacitor container opening are etched over the substrate in another two separate etching step . Thereafter , corresponding DRAM capacitor are formed within the container opening according to known processing technique . As so formed , and in accordance with the above-described spacer formation and pitch reduction concept , a plurality of pair of adjacent capacitor are formed in respective adjacent capacitor container which are separated by no more than anisotropically etched , electrically insulative sidewall spacers a will become evident below . Referring specifically to FIG . 11 , a semiconductor wafer fragment in process is shown generally at 50 and includes a layer of material 52 which may or not may be semiconductive . Transistors forming part of the DRAM circuitry array are not shown , but may be formed elevationally below the capacitor described hereafter , and contact to these underlying structure may be formed , for example , using polysilicon plug . Other elevational configuration a between transistor and capacitor are possible . A layer 54 is formed over the material 52 . In one embodiment , the layer 54 is formed from borophosphosilicate glass ( BPSG ) to a thickness around two micron . A layer 56 is then formed on the layer 54 . In one embodiment , the layer 56 is formed from silicon nitride to have a thickness of between 200 and 400 angstrom . In one embodiment , the layer 56 is formed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition . In one embodiment , the layer 56 is formed from tantalum pentoxide . A layer 58 is then formed on the layer 56 . In one embodiment , the layer 58 is formed from BPSG or from TEOS-deposited silicon dioxide . In one embodiment , the layer 58 is formed to have a thickness of between 300 and 600 Angstroms . In one embodiment , the layer 56 is formed from a material providing chemical selectivity relative to the layer 54 and 58 and thus may function a an etch stop . Referring to FIG . 12 , the layer 54 , 56 and 58 are anisotropically etched to form bit line contact and capacitor contact opening 60 through the layer 54 , 56 and 58 . Thereafter , contact material 62 is formed over the substrate and into the opening 60 . In one embodiment , the contact material 62 is conductively doped polysilicon . Such contact material 62 is or may be planarized by suitable chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etching to provide the illustrated contact or plug 62 . The plug 62 are in electrical communication with circuit node , such a transistor , that were previously formed according to known principle . The layer 58 is chosen to have a thickness sufficient that if the surface of the plug 62 are eroded by the planarization process , the plug 62 together with the layer 56 still form a continuous chemical barrier to prevent etching of the layer 54 during subsequent processing step . Referring to FIG . 13 , a thick layer 64 is then formed over the contact 62 and the layer 58 . In one embodiment , the layer 64 is formed from BPSG . In one embodiment , the layer 64 is formed to have a thickness of 1.5 micron , however , other thickness are possible . A photoresist pattern corresponding to bit line contact opening 66 is formed on the layer 64 . The bit line contact opening 66 are anisotropically etched through the layer 64 and 58 and may or may not continue through the layer 56 . In one embodiment , the bit line contact opening 66 have a width of between 0.16 and 0.26 micron . Referring to FIG . 14 , sidewall spacers 68 are formed in the bit line contact opening 66 . In one embodiment , the sidewall spacers 68 are formed by depositing a layer of silicon nitride 200 Angstroms thick and then anisotropically etching the silicon nitride layer to remove portion of the layer formed on the contact 62 and on other horizontal feature . In one embodiment , second sidewall spacers 70 are then formed within the sidewall spacers 68 . In one embodiment , the second sidewall spacers 70 are formed by depositing up to 600 Angstroms of silicon dioxide . The silicon dioxide is then anisotropically etched to remove the silicon dioxide from the contact 62 and other horizontal feature . Bit line contact 72 are then formed in opening 66 . In one embodiment , the bit line contact 72 are formed by depositing conductive polysilicon followed by planarization , such a chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etching . The sidewall spacers 68 and 70 collectively act to reduce capacitance from the bit line contact 72 to neighboring capacitor to be formed in subsequent step . The second sidewall spacers 70 may be formed from silicon dioxide and to have a greater thickness than the first sidewall spacers 68 in order to reduce capacitance , due to the reduced relative dielectric constant of silicon dioxide relative to that of silicon nitride . The first sidewall spacers 68 and the bit line contact 72 seal the second sidewall spacers 70 and prevent the second sidewall spacers from being etched during subsequent processing step . Referring to FIG . 15 , first capacitor container 76 are then formed . A photoresist layer 88 ( FIG . 19 ) is formed to define opening corresponding to the first capacitor container 76 and an anisotropic etch is used to etch through the layer 64 and 58 , stopping at the contact 62 and the layer 56 . The photoresist layer 88 is then stripped and sidewall spacers 74 are formed . In one embodiment , the sidewall spacers 74 are formed by depositing a 300 Angstrom thick layer of silicon nitride and then anisotropically etching the silicon nitride to remove it from the contact 62 and other horizontal surface . A thin photoresist layer is then applied and is exposed to remove the photoresist from the layer 64 and the bit line contact 72 but not from bottom of the first capacitor container 76 . A wet etching process such a a hydrofluoric acid etch may then be used to remove exposed portion of the layer 64 and form second capacitor container 78 , a shown in FIG . 16 . Individual container of a pair of capacitor container 76 and 78 are separated from each other by no more than the width of a non-conducting partition 74 . As discussed above with reference to the pitch advantage achieved with conductive line 44 ( FIGS . 9 and 10 ) , such advantage are achieved through the use of spacers or partition 74 which electrically isolate adjacent capacitor formed in respective capacitor container 76 and 78 . Referring to FIGS . 17 and 18 , electrically conductive container material 80 is formed over the substrate and planarized ( FIG . 18 ) to define a plurality of capacitor storage node in selected container shape . In one embodiment , the electrically conductive container material 80 is conductive polysilicon . In one embodiment , the electrically conductive container material 80 is hemispherical grain polysilicon . In one embodiment , the hemispherical grain polysilicon provides an HSG factor of about 1.8 , that is , provides an increase in surface area of 1.8 relative to that of a comparable flat polysilicon layer . Subsequently , capacitor are formed according to conventional formation technique by provision of a dielectric layer 82 over respective storage node 76 , 78 and provision of a subsequent polysilicon layer 84 thereover . As so formed , capacitor in respective partitioned part of the area defined by capacitor container 76 and 78 are separated from immediately adjacent capacitor or have a closest separation distance which is substantially no greater than the width of the partition or spacer 74 between the capacitor . Referring to FIG . 19 , a diagrammatic semiconductor mask layout and DRAM array is designated generally by reference numeral 88 . Layout 88 is utilized to enable the above-described container to be selectively , alternately formed or etched in the two described separate etching step . For purpose of clarity , FIG . 15 is taken along line 1515 in FIG . 19 at a processing point just after the etching of opening 76 ( FIG . 15 ) using layout 88 . Layout 88 enables capacitor having unique , space-saving geometry to be formed over the substrate . According to one aspect of the invention , the electrically insulative partition 74 ( FIG . 15 ) are formed between adjacent capacitor intermediate the two etching step which form or define the area over the substrate in which the capacitor will be formed . The partition 74 are not shown for clarity in FIG . 19 . Mask layout 88 includes a plurality of row such a those illustrated at R1 , R2 , R3 and R4 . The mask layout also includes a plurality of column such a those illustrated at C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 , C6 and C7 . A plurality of masked area 90 and a plurality of adjacent unmasked area 92 are defined by the layout . Unmasked area 92 correspond to capacitor container opening pattern 76 in FIG . 15 and masked area 90 correspond to photoresist . Layout 88 enables a plurality of capacitor to be formed , which may be a part of a DRAM array over the substrate , wherein respective alternate capacitor in a row , such a row R1-R4 , have substantially similar lateral width profile transverse the row . In one embodiment , respective adjacent capacitor in a row have different lateral width profile transverse the row . The illustrated lateral width profile when viewed from a point above the substrate approximate triangle which are oriented in a top-to-bottom fashion across the row . Additionally , individual defined area in which the capacitor pair are to be formed ( corresponding to the view taken along line 1515 in column C5 ) approximate a diamond shape with such shape having at it respective corner , bit line contact 94 which are formed a described above . For purpose of the ongoing discussion , each of column C1-C7 are formed along a generally straight line which is generally transverse each of row R1-R4 . Further , the array of capacitor pair to be formed are formed along individual line which contain at least one of the pair of capacitor . As such , the array is defined by a plurality of the line ( corresponding to the plurality of the column ) which contain a plurality of capacitor which are separated by substantially no more than an electrically insulative anisotropically etched spacer 74 a described above . Underlying word line are shown by dashed line 93 and interconnect associated transistor formed relative to the substrate . Individual bit line are not specifically shown but are subsequently formed and oriented generally transversely relative to the word line 93 . It ha been discovered that two different effect can distort relative size of the first , dry etched capacitor container 76 relative to the second , wet etched capacitor container 78 . A first of these effect is that the wet clean following the dry etch used to form the dry etched container may also enlarge the first capacitor container 76 , in part by tending to make the first capacitor container 76 more rounded . This tends to cause the first capacitor container 76 to be enlarged relative to the second capacitor container 78 . The first effect tends to be exacerbated by need to wet etch to remove any remaining BPSG from side of the bit line contact 72 . A second of these effect is that , especially for very small first and second capacitor container 76 and 78 , exposure of positive photoresist tends to result in curvature or rounding of edge of the photoresist pattern 90 , which also tends to enlarge the first capacitor container 76 relative to the second capacitor container 78 . It ha been further discovered that these effect may be ameliorated by using a negative resist to form the photoresist pattern 90 . Use of a negative resist tends to reverse the direction of curvature of the edge of the photoresist pattern 90 . In turn , this allows a longer wet etch in order to ensure complete removal of any BPSG remaining on side of the bit line contact 72 . As a result , pattern distortion originating in the photolithography process used to define the photoresist pattern 90 tend to cancel out pattern distortion of the first capacitor container 76 originating in the wet etch process used to define the second capacitor container 78 . In turn , the first and second capacitor container 76 and 78 tend to be more nearly equal , resulting in improved DRAM operation and in improved operating margin for such DRAMs . Referring to FIG . 20 , a mask layout 88 defines in part a DRAM array which includes a plurality of six-capacitor geometry which are to be formed over the substrate . A representative of one of the geometry is indicated generally by reference numeral 96 and a plurality of adjacent or other geometry are shown in phantom line . The illustrated six-capacitor geometry are , in turn , defined by a plurality of individual polygonal capacitor geometry shown collectively at 98 through 108 . In one embodiment , collective individual capacitor geometry 98 through 108 approximate a hexagon , individual side of which are defined by a side of a different respective one of the individual polygonal capacitor geometry . For example , the six-capacitor geometry or hexagon 96 includes six side collectively shown at 96 a , 96 b , 96 c , 96 d , 96 e and 96 f. Each of such side is defined by a different respective one of the individual side of the individual polygonal capacitor geometry 98 through 108 . According to one embodiment of the invention , the individual polygonal capacitor geometry 98 through 108 , when viewed outwardly of the substrate , approximate a wedge or wedge-shape . In one embodiment , such individual geometry approximate a triangle which may be an isosceles triangle . In one embodiment , individual approximated isosceles triangle include equal adjacent angle which approximate a range of between about 50 to 70 . Such equal adjacent angle are shown for the individual geometry 100 , 104 and 108 . In one embodiment , such equal adjacent angle approximate an angle of about 65 . The individual geometry 98 through 102 and 104 through 108 , respectively , may be arranged in a top-to-bottom orientation such that the hexagon 96 can be bisected , a shown by dashed line 110 , into half containing exactly three individual polygonal capacitor geometry . In the illustrated hexagon , one of the half , a top half a viewed in FIG . 20 , contains the individual geometry 98 , 100 and 102 . The other of the half , a bottom half , contains the geometry 104 , 106 and 108 . Referring to FIG . 21 , the top half containing the geometry 98 , 100 and 102 is shown , comprising a three-capacitor geometry 112 . A plurality of three-capacitor geometry 112 are disposed over the substrate . In one embodiment , the three-capacitor geometry 112 , when viewed outwardly of the substrate , defines a pair of overlapping approximated parallelogram , the intersection of which approximates a triangle . A first of such parallelogram is shown at 114 . A second of such parallelogram is shown at 116 . The parallelogram 114 includes side 114 a , 114 b , 114 c and 114 d. The parallelogram 116 includes side 116 a , 116 b , 116 c and 116 d. The parallelogram share side 114 b and 116 d. As shown , each approximated parallelogram is bounded at a respective one of it corner by a bit line contact 94 . The approximated triangle defined by the intersection of the parallelogram 114 , 116 includes side 114 c , 116 c and shared side 114 b/116 d. For purpose of ongoing discussion , a plurality of capacitor pair are selectively and alternately etched over the substrate along etch ax which are generally orthogonal relative to the substrate and into the plane of the page upon which FIG . 21 appears . Such capacitor pair can approximate the above described parallelogram and would include the individual capacitor etched a a result of individual geometry 98 , 100 , or alternatively 100 , 102 . Referring to both FIGS . 16 and 19 , a DRAM array is formed atop a substrate and includes a first set of capacitor formed in first set of capacitor container 76 over the substrate . A second set of capacitor are formed over the substrate and in second set capacitor container 78 . Individual capacitor of the first set are bounded by at least three capacitor from the second set ( FIG . 19 ) . In one embodiment , individual first set capacitor have a closest separation distance from at least one of the three bounding capacitor which is substantially no more than a width of an electrically insulative anisotropically etched spacer 74 ( FIG . 16 ) . In one embodiment , individual bounded first set capacitor have closest separation distance from no le than two and possibly three of the bounding capacitor which are no more than the width of an electrically insulative anisotropically etched spacer formed or provided between the respective capacitor . The above described semiconductor device forming method and integrated circuitry formed thereby constitute an improvement which relates to device spacing over a substrate . Such improvement enables device pitch to be reduced by almost fifty percent or more which represents a substantial space saving over heretofore available method and device . In compliance with the statute , the invention ha been described in language more or le specific a to structural and methodical feature .

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention pertains to low power and high speed integrated circuit in the compound semiconductor field utilizing field effect transistor and more specifically complementary field effect transistor used in concert including enhancement mode self-aligned metal-oxide-compound semiconductor transistor and depletion mode self-aligned metal-oxide-compound semiconductor transistor and method of material growth and fabrication of said structure and the ultra large scale integration of said transistor . DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND The gallium arsenide and indium phosphide integrated circuit industry ha been limited without a technology that simultaneously allows the integration of complementary field effect transistor device and transistor with low gate leakage current . In contrast to silicon technology that ha a very mature and useful complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) technology . Field effect transistor ( FETs ) widely used in the III-V semiconductor industry employ metal gate and Schottky gate contact that are have quiescent-state leakage current exceeding many microamps . The use of metal gate in compound semiconductor technology further result in individual transistor and integrated circuit that have excessively high power dissipation , reduced transconductance , reduced logic swing and the inability to operate on a single power supply , and generally limited performance characteristic . The high magnitude of the quiescent leakage current limit the maximum integration of GaAs device to circuit of several hundred thousand transistor for those skilled in the art . In contrast , the simultaneous integration of many million of transistor is possible at high integration density using silicon CMOS technology . These ultra high integration density and level can not be obtained using metal , Schottky-style gate that are not insulated in compound semiconductor FETs . Thus Si CMOS technology offer significant advantage in term of individual gate leakage , circuit integration level and cost . However when compared to silicon , complementary GaAs and InP circuit technology exhibit faster and more optimized speed/power performance and efficiency at a low supply voltage of 1V and below . The market acceptance of these GaAs and InP integrated circuit technology remains low because of the lack of ability to demonstrate high integration density with low amount of operating power . Thus , silicon CMOS dominates the field of digital integrated circuitry and neither GaAs nor InP technology can successfully penetrate this market .

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 . Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same , and more particularly to an MIS ( Metal Insulator Semiconductor ) -type semiconductor device in which a gate electrode made of , for example , polycrystalline silicon is formed on a silicon substrate with a gate insulating film made of amorphous aluminate , and being sandwiched between the gate electrode and the silicon substrate , and to the method for manufacturing the same . The present application claim priority of Japanese Patent Application No . 2002-381216 filed on Dec. 27 , 2002 , which is hereby incorporated by reference . 2 . Description of the Related Art In recent year , to satisfy a need for scale-down and high integration of a semiconductor device , when silicon oxide ( SiO2 ) is used a a gate insulating film , it is necessary to reduce it film thickness of , for example , an FET ( Field Effect Transistor ) to several nanometer or le . However , a problem arises that , if the gate insulating film is made so extremely thin , a tunnel current flowing when a gate bias is applied becomes so large , compared with a source-drain current , that it can not be neglected . To solve this problem , a method is proposed in which , by using an insulator material having a relative dielectric constant being higher than that of silicon oxide , a gate insulating film practically and effectively made thin . For example , a method for manufacturing an FET is disclosed in , for example , Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No . 2002-314072 in which zirconium oxide having a relative dielectric constant r being about 30 is used a a material for a gate insulating film instead of silicon oxide ( see FIG . 15 ) . The disclosed FET 101 , a shown in FIG . 15 , ha a silicon substrate 103 on which a source-drain region 102 is formed , a gate insulating film 104 being deposited on the silicon substrate 103 , and a gate electrode 105 made of polycrystalline silicon ( poly-Si ) formed on the gate insulating film 104 . In the technology , an aluminum oxide layer 106 is deposited on the silicon substrate 103 , serving a a seed layer , and a zirconium oxide layer 107 is deposited on the aluminum oxide layer 106 . As shown in FIG . 15 , in manufacturing the FET 101 , the gate insulating film 104 a multilayer is formed on the silicon substrate 103 , by depositing in sequence and stacking the aluminum oxide layer 106 and zirconium oxide layer 107 both being amorphous on the silicon substrate 103 . Also , another method for manufacturing an FET 201 is proposed , a shown in FIG . 16 , in which hafnium oxide having a relative dielectric constant r being about 20 is used a the material for the gate insulating film . The FET 201 , a shown in FIG . 16 , ha a silicon substrate 203 on which a source-drain region 202 is formed , a gate insulating film 204 made of hafnium oxide being deposited on the silicon substrate 203 , and a gate electrode 205 formed directly on the gate insulating film 204 . To manufacture the FET 201 , a hafnium oxide layer is deposited on the silicon substrate 203 to form the gate insulating film 204 . Here , a film thickness considering the relative dielectric constant of metal oxide is simply called an EOT ( Equivalent Oxide Thickness ) . As shown by a characteristic curve Lp in FIG . 17 , a relation between the EOT and a leakage current density obtained when a metal is used a a material for the gate electrode 205 in the FET 201 in FIG . 16 is excellent . In FIG . 17 , a characteristic curve Lq show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when polycrystalline silicon is used a the material for the gate electrode 205 . Also , in FIG . 17 , a characteristic curve Lr show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when polycrystalline silicon is used a the material for the gate electrode 205 and the gate insulating film 204 is made up of only aluminum oxide and a characteristic curve Ls show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when polycrystalline silicon is used a the material for the gate electrode 205 and the gate insulating film 204 is made up of only silicon oxide . Moreover , when metal a described above are used a the material for the gate electrode 205 , though an experiment on only such the characteristic a the relation between the EOT and leakage current density show good result , the metal can not be practically employed due to following reason . That is , in an LSI ( Large Scale Integrated Circuit ) , two kind of FETs ( Field Effect Transistors ) , one being an nMOSFET ( n-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET ) and another being a pMOSFET ( p-type MOSFET ) . Therefore , it is necessary to form gate electrode each having a different work function on a same wafer at the same time . When polycrystalline silicon or germanium polycrystalline silicon is used a a material for the gate electrode , by performing a doping process , the work function of the gate electrode can be changed . However , if metal are used a the material for the gate electrode , since a work function can not be changed , there is a difficulty in manufacturing a CMOS ( Complementary MOS ) . Also , generally , if metal are used a a material for the gate electrode , the gate insulating film is easily short-circuited due to a reaction between the gate electrode and gate insulating film caused by heat treatment for source/drain activation . To solve this problem , by using polycrystalline silicon or a like a the material for the gate electrode and , at the same time , by using a material having a high relative dielectric constant a the material for the gate insulating film , an effort to obtain the excellent characteristic ( the relation between the EOT and leakage current density ) is made . However , this method ha also a problem in that , if zirconium oxide is used a the material for the gate insulating film , crystallization of amorphous zirconium oxide occurs due to heat treatment in a process of forming the gate electrode 105 or of forming the source/drain region 102 , or if polycrystalline silicon is used a the material for the gate electrode 105 , a short-circuit is made due to incompatibility with zirconium oxide . Moreover , an another problem arises that , if hafnium oxide is used a the material for the gate insulating film , crystallization of the hafnium oxide easily occurs due to heat treatment which cause occurrence of a grain boundary passing through higher and lower electrode . These problem cause an increase in a leakage current leading to easy occurrence of dielectric breakdown and to reduction in reliability of semiconductor device . Furthermore , if polycrystalline silicon is used a a material for the gate electrode , an electrostatic capacity becomes lower compared with the case where metal are used a the material for the gate electrode and , a shown by the characteristic curve Lq in FIG . 17 , the EOT is greatly degraded compared with the case shown by the characteristic curve Lp . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above , it is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which is capable of improving it reliability , even when a polycrystalline semiconductor such a a polycrystalline silicon or a like is used a a material for it gate electrode , by using a material having a high relative dielectric constant for a gate insulating film , by suppressing degradation of an EOT and by preventing crystallization of the material having a high relative dielectric constant , and a method for manufacturing the same .

Also , a preferable mode is one wherein a ratio of a thickness of the second insulating region to a thickness of the first insulating region is set to be or more and 1.0 or le . Also , a preferable mode is one wherein a thickness of the insulating film is 2 nanometer or more and 5 nanometer or le . Also , a preferable mode is one wherein a seed layer made of silicon oxide is sandwiched between the substrate and the insulating film . According to a second aspect of the present invention , there is provided a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device including : an insulating film forming process of forming an insulating film made of metal oxide containing aluminum and hafnium on a substrate ; and an electrode forming process of forming an electrode on the insulating film ; wherein the insulating film forming process includes a first insulating film forming process of forming a first insulating film being hafnium-rich on the substrate and a second insulating film forming process of forming a second insulating film being aluminum-rich on the first insulating film and wherein , in the electrode forming process , the electrode is formed on the second insulating film . In the foregoing , a preferable mode is one wherein the metal oxide to be used in the insulating film forming process is made of amorphous metal oxide and the electrode to be formed in the electrode forming process is made of a polycrystalline semiconductor . Also , a preferable mode is one wherein , in the insulating film forming process , the insulating film is so formed that a hafnium concentration becomes lower monotonously and an aluminum concentration becomes higher monotonously or step by step along a direction of a thickness of the insulating film from a side of the substrate toward a side of the electrode . Also , a preferable mode is one that wherein includes a third insulating film forming process of forming a third insulating film in which concentration of hafnium and aluminum contained in the metal oxide change along a direction of a thickness of the insulating film between the first insulating film and the second insulating film . Also , a preferable mode is one wherein , in the first insulating film forming process , the first insulating film is so formed that a ratio of hafnium atom to a sum of a number of aluminum atom and hafnium atom in the first insulating region is 0.5 or more and 0.8 or le and , in the second insulating film forming process , the second insulating film is so formed that a ratio of aluminum atom to a sum of a number of aluminum atom and hafnium atom in the second insulating region is 0.5 or more and 1.0 or le .

Also , a preferable mode is one wherein a thickness of the insulating film is 2 nanometer or more and 5 nanometer or le . Also , a preferable mode is one that wherein a thermal treatment process of changing , at least continuously , the aluminum concentration and hafnium concentration along a direction of a thickness of the insulating film by performing the thermal treatment process after the electrode forming process . Also , a preferable mode is one wherein , in the insulating film forming process , the insulating film is formed by an atomic-layer deposition ( ALD ) method .

Furthermore , a preferable mode is one that wherein includes a seed layer forming process of forming a seed layer made of silicon oxide on the substrate before the first insulating film forming process . With the above configuration , the insulating film contains hafnium oxide being a high dielectric constant material a a compositional material and , therefore , by distributing hafnium while changing a concentration all over region of the insulating film , lowering of a relative dielectric constant of the entire insulating film can be suppressed and the required EOT can be obtained . With still another configuration , the concentration of aluminum is set to be comparatively high in a region having a specified thickness immediately below the electrode and , therefore , by using a polycrystalline semiconductor a a gate electrode , lowering in an EOT of the insulating film occurring when hafnium oxide is singly used a the insulating film can be suppressed , which enables electrostatic capacitance to be prevented from being lowered . With still another configuration , aluminum is contained not only in the second insulating region but also in the first insulating region where hafnium is contained in a comparatively high concentration and , therefore , crystallization of hafnium oxide can be suppressed . As a result , occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the insulating film can be suppressed and an increase in leakage current can be prevented . This enables dielectric breakdown to be avoided and reliability of semiconductor device to be improved . Thus , since the crystallization of hafnium oxide can be suppressed , it is possible to improve surface roughness and to avoid local concentration of electric field at region having small thickness and to reduce leakage current , which improve reliability of semiconductor device . With still another configuration , after the second insulating region ha been stacked on the first insulating film , by performing the thermal treatment process , the concentration of aluminum and hafnium can be changed continuously and , therefore , it is possible to prevent such a problem a a decrease in a threshold value caused by trapped electric charge in the boundary region . With still another configuration , the ALD method is used to form the insulating film and , therefore , the concentration of aluminum and hafnium can be precisely controlled , thus improving quality of the insulating film and contamination caused by carbon contained in the material gas can be prevented by introducing the purge gas .

The ALD system 11 is made up of a vacuum container 12 in which a specified degree of vacuum is maintained , a heating table 13 on which a workpiece ( substance ) to be treated is put , gas introducing pipe 14 a , 14 b , 14 c , and 14 d to be used for introducing material gas or a like into the vacuum container 12 , and a gas exhausting pipe 16 attached on a side opposite to a side on which the material gas is introduced into the vacuum container 12 and being connected to a vacuum pump 15 . TMA ( Trimethyl aluminum , Al ( CH3 ) 3 ) , hafnium tetrachloride ( HfCl4 ) , and ozone ( O3 ) are introduced , a the material gas , into the vacuum container 12 in the ALD system 11 through the gas introducing pipe 14 a , 14 b , and 14 c , respectively , with timing being different from one another and repeatedly in a pulse-like manner and at specified periodical interval at about 300 C. and the aluminum oxide layer and hafnium oxide layer are continuously formed and stacked , layer by layer , in a specified sequence in a manner so a to have a specified composition . Moreover , during a period after completion of the introduction of each material gas before introduction of subsequent same material gas or different material gas , nitrogen ( N2 ) is introduced a a purge gas through the gas introducing pipe 14 d in a pulse-like manner . In FIGS . 6 and 7 , pulse-like waveform pa , pb , pc , and pd represent , respectively , flow rate of TMA , ozone , hafnium tetrachloride and nitrogen , which change with a passage of time t. In the embodiment , a shown in FIG . 6 , specified flow rate Qa of TMA is first introduced into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 a during a gas introducing time ta ( t1tt2 ) . Next , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during a gas introducing time td ( t3tt4 ) . Then , specified flow rate Qb of ozone is introduced a an oxidizing agent into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 b during the gas introducing time tb ( t5tt6 ) . Furthermore , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t7tt8 ) . By these operation , one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide is formed . Next , specified flow rate Qc of hafnium tetrachloride is introduced into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 c during the gas introducing time tc ( t9tt10 ) . Then , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t11tt12 ) . Next , specified flow rate Qb of ozone is introduced a an oxidizing agent into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 b during the gas introducing time tb ( t13tt14 ) . Furthermore , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t15tt16 ) . By these operation , one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide is formed . Next , operation of the introduction of hafnium tetrachloride , nitrogen , ozone , and nitrogen described above are repeated twice in addition . That is , by introducing hafnium tetrachloride during the gas introducing time tc ( t17tt18 ) , nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t19tt20 ) , ozone during the gas introducing time tb ( t21tt22 ) , and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t23tt24 ) , additional one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide is formed . Then , by introducing hafnium tetrachloride during the gas introducing time ( t25tt26 ) , nitrogen during the gas introducing time ( t27tt28 ) , ozone during the gas introducing time ( t29tt30 ) , and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time ( t31tt32 ) , further additional one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide is formed . Thus , since three layer ( 3 mono-layers ) of hafnium oxide are deposited on one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide , the hafnium aluminate layer having a specified composition ratio is formed when viewed macroscopically . In the embodiment a shown in FIG . 6 , time t ( =t33t1 ) required for the formation of the one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide and three layer of hafnium oxide is set to be several second . Then , the above formation process of the one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide and three layer of hafnium oxide is repeatedly performed . By these operation , the lower layer gate insulating film 8 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate having a specified composition ratio is formed when viewed macroscopically . Next , a shown in FIG . 3C , an upper layer gate insulating film ( second insulating film ) 18 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate containing a specified concentration of hafnium and aluminum is formed on the lower layer gate insulating film 8 by the ALD method . That is , a shown in FIG . 7 , specified flow rate Qc of hafnium tetrachloride is introduced into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 c during the gas introducing time tc ( t51tt52 ) . Next , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a a purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t53tt54 ) . Then , specified flow rate Qb of ozone is introduced a an oxidizing agent into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 b during the gas introducing time tb ( t55tt56 ) . Furthermore , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t57tt58 ) . By these operation , one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide is formed . Next , specified flow rate Qa of TMA is introduced into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 a during the gas introducing time ta ( t59tt60 ) . Then , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t61tt62 ) . Then , specified flow rate Qb of ozone is introduced a the oxidizing agent into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 b during the gas introducing time tb ( t63tt64 ) . Furthermore , specified flow rate Qd of nitrogen is introduced a the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introducing pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td ( t65tt66 ) . By these operation , one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide is formed . Next , operation of the introduction of TMA , nitrogen , ozone , and nitrogen described above are repeated twice in addition . That is , by introducing TMA during the gas introducing time ta ( t67tt68 ) , nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t69tt70 ) , ozone during the gas introducing time tb ( t71tt72 ) , and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t73tt74 ) , additional one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide is formed . Then , by introducing TMA during the gas introducing time ta ( t75tt76 ) , nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t77tt78 ) , ozone during the gas introducing time tb ( t79tt80 ) , and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time td ( t81tt82 ) , further additional one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of aluminum oxide is formed . Thus , since three layer of aluminum oxide are deposited on one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide , the hafnium aluminate layer having a specified composition ratio is formed when viewed macroscopically . In the embodiment a shown in FIG . 7 , time t ( =t83t51 ) required for the formation of the one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of afnium oxide and three layer ( 3 mono-layers ) of aluminum oxide is set to be several second . Then the above formation process of the one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide and three layer of aluminum oxide is repeatedly performed . By these operation the upper layer gate insulating film 18 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate having a specified composition ratio is formed when viewed macroscopically . Moreover in the embodiment a film thickness of the upper layer insulating film 18 is about one third or more of that of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 . Next a gate electrode made of for example polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . That is a shown in FIG . 3D an electrode layer 19 made of polycrystalline silicon ( p-Si ) having a film thickness of for example 50 ( 5 nm ) is deposited on the upper layer gate insulating film 18 by using a CVD ( Chemical vapor Deposition ) method . Next a shown in FIG . 4A a gate electrode 6 is formed by performing patterning operation using photolithography and etching technology . As shown in FIG . 8 a hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 8 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( 0dda ) and to be for example 25 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( daddg ) and is set so a to be discontinuously change at a boundary region ( d=da ) . Here da represents a thickness of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and dg represents a total thickness of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . In this case an aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and to be 75 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 and a relation of [ Na [ % ] =100Nh ] is maintained . Then after specified impurity have been implanted into the silicon substrate 3 by using the gate electrode 6 a a mask an annealing process is performed at a temperature of for example 1000 C. to form the source-drain region 2 a shown in FIG . 4B . Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and upper layer gate insulating film 18 the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion a a result causing the boundary to disappear and the single layer gate insulating film 5 to be formed . Thus the FET 1 a shown in FIG . 1 is obtained . Next a characteristic in the region in the obtained FET 1 where the gate insulating film 5 is formed is described by referring to FIG . 1 and FIG . 9 . Especially in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 shown in FIG . 1 since the region is positioned immediately below the gate electrode 6 the concentration of aluminum is set to be comparatively high . This enables prevention of degradation of the EOT of the gate insulating film 5 caused by use of polycrystalline silicon ( polycrystalline semiconductor ) a the material for the gate electrode 6 and by use of only hafnium oxide a the material for the gate insulating film 5 and thus enables suppression of lowering in electrostatic capacitance which serf to reduce leakage current . Moreover since the gate insulating film 5 contains a specified concentration of hafnium lowering of a dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 is suppressed which serf to ensure a required EOT . Also since in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be relatively high lowering in the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 is suppressed thus serving to ensure the required EOT and at the same time since a specified concentration of aluminum is contained crystallization of hafnium oxide can be prevented . Therefore occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppressed thus serving to prevent an increase in leakage current . Moreover an investigation of a relation between the EOT and leakage current density made to evaluate a characteristic of the FET 1 show good result a shown in FIG . 9 . In FIG . 9 a characteristic curve L1 show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density in the FET 1 of the embodiment . Also a characteristic curve La show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when metal are used a the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide . Furthermore characteristic curve Lb Lc and Ld show relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when polycrystalline silicon is used a the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide only aluminum oxide and only silicon oxide respectively . As shown in FIG . 9 in the case of the FET 1 of the embodiment the EOT is greatly reduced when compared with the case where the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide and it characteristic come near to that obtained when metal are used a the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide . Thus according to the configuration of the FET of the embodiment since in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 whose thickness occupies about three fourth of all thickness of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of hafnium being a material having a high dielectric constant is made comparatively high and since also in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 hafnium is contained in a specified concentration it is possible to suppress lowering of the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 and to ensure the required EOT . Moreover since in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of aluminum is made comparatively high and since in the region immediately below the gate electrode 6 the aluminum concentration Na is made particularly high when polycrystalline silicon ( polycrystalline semiconductor ) is used a the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide it is possible to suppress lowering of an electrostatic capacitance that is to prevent degradation of the EOT and to reduce leakage current . Also not only in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 but also in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 in which the concentration of hafnium is set to be relatively high aluminum is contained in a specified concentration which enables crystallization of hafnium oxide to be suppressed . As a result occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppressed and an increase in leakage current can be prevented . This enables dielectric breakdown to be reduced thus improving reliability of the semiconductor device . Also since crystallization of hafnium oxide can be suppressed surface roughness can be improved and a local concentration of electric field in a region in which film thickness is small can be avoided which enables leakage current to be reduced thus improving reliability of the semiconductor device . Moreover by providing heat treatment after the upper layer gate insulating film 18 ha been deposited on the lower layer gate insulating film 8 the aluminum concentration Na and hafnium concentration Nh can be made changeable continuously in the boundary region it is possible to prevent such a problem a a decrease in a threshold value of the gate insulating film 5 caused by trapped electric charge in the boundary region . Also since the ALD method is used to form the gate insulating film 5 improvement of film quality of the gate insulating film 5 is made possible by precisely controlling concentration of aluminum and hafnium and contamination caused by carbon contained in the material gas can be prevented by introducing the purge gas .

FIG . 11 is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating configuration of intermediate region in a gate insulating film of the FET 21 of the second embodiment . FIG . 12 is a characteristic diagram briefly showing a relation between a distance from an interface of the gate insulating film on a substrate side in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 and a hafnium concentration Nh obtained after heat treatment in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . FIGS . 13A 13B and 13C are process diagram illustrating a method for manufacturing the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . FIG . 14 is a characteristic diagram briefly showing a relation between a distance from the interface of the gate insulating film on the substrate side in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 and a hafnium concentration Nh obtained before heat treatment in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . The FET 21 of the second embodiment differs greatly from the FET 1 employed in the first embodiment in that in the first embodiment after the lower layer insulating film 8 and upper layer insulating film 18 have been formed concentration are continuously changed at the boundary region 5 c in a process of heat treatment however in the second embodiment after a plurality of intermediate insulating film whose hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are changed in stage ha been formed between a lower gate insulating film and an upper gate insulating film and a heat treatment process is performed . Configurations other than described above are almost the same a those in the first embodiment and their description are made simple accordingly . The FET ( semiconductor device ) 21 of the second embodiment a shown in FIG . 10 includes a silicon substrate 23 having a source-drain region 22 into which specified impurity have been implanted is formed a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide being deposited on the silicon substrate 23 a gate insulating film 25 formed on the seed layer 24 a gate electrode 26 made of for example polycrystalline silicon being deposited on the gate insulating film 25 . The gate insulating film 25 ha a specified thickness ( for example 20 to 50 that is about 2 nm to 5 nm ) and is so formed that each of composition ratio change along a direction of it thickness toward the gate electrode 6 from a side of the silicon substrate 23 thus causing a hafnium concentration Nh to monotonously become lower and an aluminum concentration Na to monotonously become higher . Moreover a shown in FIG . 10 the gate insulating film 25 ha a region 25 a ( first insulating region ) on a lower layer side immediately above the silicon substrate 23 a region 25 b ( second insulating region ) on an upper layer side immediately below the gate electrode 26 and an intermediate region 25 c ( third insulating region ) being sandwiched between the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side and both the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are almost constant in each of the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side . As shown in FIG . 11 and FIG . 12 the intermediate region 25 c ( d3dd10 ) ha a first intermediate region 25 p ( d4dd5 ) a second intermediate region 25 q ( d6dd7 ) a third intermediate region 25 r ( d8dd9 ) a boundary region 25 s ( d3dd4 ) between the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the first intermediate region 25 p a boundary region 25 t ( d5dd6 ) between the first intermediate region 25 p and the secondary intermediate region 25 q a boundary region 25 u ( d7dd8 ) between the second intermediate region 25 q and the third intermediate region 25 r and a boundary region 25 v ( d9dd10 ) between the third intermediate region 25 r and region 25 b on the upper layer side . Here in the first intermediate region 25 p second intermediate region 25 q and third intermediate region 25 r each of the hafnium and the aluminum ha a specified concentration being almost constant and in the boundary region 25 s the boundary region 25 t the boundary region 25 u and the boundary region 25 v each of the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na continuously change . As shown in FIG . 12 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the region 25 a on the lower layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be for example 25 % in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and change continuously and in stage in the intermediate region 25 c. In this case the aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the region 25 a on the lower layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be 75 % in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and a relation of ( Na=100Nh ) is maintained . Next a method for manufacturing the FET 21 of the second embodiment is described by referring to FIG . 13 . First a shown in FIG . 13A a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide is formed on a silicon substrate 23 by the thermal oxidation method . Then a lower layer gate insulating film 27 made of hafnium aluminate containing a specified concentration of hafnium and aluminum is formed on the seed layer 24 by the ALD method . Then the first intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 28 second intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 29 third intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 31 are formed on the lower layer gate insulating film 27 in a manner that the hafnium concentration Nh becomes lower in order ( the aluminum concentration Na becomes higher in order ) . Next the upper layer gate insulating film 32 whose hafnium concentration Nh is made lower than that of the third intermediate insulating film 31 is formed on the third intermediate insulating film 31 . Then an electrode layer 33 made of polycrystalline silicon is formed on the upper layer gate insulating film 32 for example by the CVD method . Then a shown in FIG . 13B a gate electrode 26 is formed by performing patterning operation using photolithography and etching technology . As shown in FIG . 14 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 27 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( 0ddb ) and to be for example 25 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( dfddg ) and is set to be a specified constant value so a to become lower in order within a range of ( 25 % Nh75 % ) in each of the first intermediate insulating film 28 that is in a region within a range of ( dbddc ) the second intermediate insulating film 29 that is in a region within a range of ( dcdde ) and the third intermediate insulating film 31 ( deddf ) and is set so a to discontinuously change in each of the boundary region ( d=db dc de and df ) . In this case the aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 27 and to be 75 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 and a relation of Na [ % ] =100Nh is maintained . Then after specified impurity have been implanted into the silicon substrate 23 by using the gate electrode 26 a a mask an annealing process is performed to form a source-drain region 22 a shown in FIG . 13C . Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 27 and the first intermediate insulating film 28 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the first intermediate insulating film 28 and the second intermediate insulating film 29 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the second intermediate insulating film 29 and the third intermediate insulating film 31 and in a region in the vicinity of the third intermediate insulating film 31 and the upper layer gate insulating film 32 the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion causing the boundary to disappear and a a result the single layer gate insulating film 25 to be formed . Thus the FET 21 a shown in FIG . 10 is obtained . According to the second embodiment almost the same effect a achieved in the first embodiment described above can be obtained . Additionally since the change in concentration in the boundary region is made more mild the characteristic can be more improved . It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment but may be changed and modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention . For example in the above embodiment the gate insulating film 5 and 25 are formed by the ALD method however instead of the ALD method the CVD method can be used for forming the gate insulating film 5 or 25 . This enables a throughput ( processing capability ) to be improved . The CVD method that can be used here includes for example an atmospheric CVD method a reduced pressure CVD method a plasma enhanced CVD method or a like . Moreover the gate electrode can be formed a a multi-layer structure in which metal layer are stacked on a polycrystalline layer . Polycrystalline silicon-germanium [ SiGe ] instead of polycrystalline silicon can be used a a material for the gate electrode . The material gas that can be used when the gate insulating film 5 or 25 are formed by the ALD method includes Hf ( NMe2 ) 4 [ tetrakis ( dimethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( NEt2 ) 4 [ tetrakis ( diethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( NMeEt ) 4 [ tetrakis ( methylethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( t-Bu ) 4 [ tetra t-butyl hafnium ] instead of HfCl4 [ hafnium tetrachloride ] . Also a the oxidizing agent instead of ozone ( O3 ) oxygen ( O2 ) or water ( H2O ) may be used . The formation of the seed layer 4 or 24 may be omitted . In the above embodiment by the thermal treatment in the process of forming the source-drain region the concentration of hafnium or aluminum is changed continuously in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . However to make continuous the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum a thermal treatment in a process of forming a gate electrode may be used or a thermal treatment process to make mild the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum may be provided separately . The temperature for the thermal treatment is set to be within a range between 800 C. or more and 1000 C. or le . Also in the above first embodiment the boundary region 5 c is formed where the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are continuously changed along a thickness direction of the gate insulating film 5 by the thermal treatment however the FET of the present invention may be so constructed a to have an interface instead of the boundary region 5 c. Moreover in the first embodiment each of the hafnium concentration Nh and the aluminum concentration Na is constant in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 and the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 however the present invention is not limited to this that is the FET may be constructed so that the hafnium concentration Nh becomes lower and the aluminum concentration Na becomes higher in these region 5 a and 5 b along a direction from a side of the substrate to a side of the gate electrode . In the first embodiment the thickness of the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about three fourth and the thickness of the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about one fourth however the present invention is not limited to this that is a ratio of the thickness of the upper layer region 5 b may be made higher . Furthermore in the second embodiment the three layer of the intermediate insulating film each having a different hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are formed however the present invention is not limited to this that is two layer or four layer or more of the intermediate insulating film may be formed .

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a sensor with at least one silicon-based micromechanical structure , and to a method for producing such a sensor . Sensors that have silicon-based micromechanical structure are known . If the micromechanical structure is movable element ( sensor element ) , then such sensor can be used a acceleration sensor , rotary acceleration sensor , inclination sensor , resonant magnetic field sensor , or rotation rate sensor . Typically , these sensor comprise a foundation wafer , which is usually likewise formed from material that contains silicon , in which the structure is integrated into a so-called sensor chamber of it surface . To protect the structure and the atmosphere prevailing in the sensor chamber , the foundation wafer is covered with a cap wafer , with a covering that cover at least the sensor chamber . This cap wafer , because of it micromechanical prestructuring , ha many individual cap joined together , of which each individual cap come to rest exactly above the sensor chamber and is soldered to the sensor chamber in hermetically sealed fashion , and thus hermetically seal off the underlying sensor structure from the environment . From German Patent Disclosure DE 195 37 814 A1 , the production of such sensor is known . Based on a silicon substrate , insulation layer and conductive layer ( in the form of electrode or electrical connection ) are applied in alternation , using the conventional method step known from semiconductor technology . By mean of masking and machining method , also known , structuring of such layer can be done , for instance by way of lithography or etching process . In an ensuing process step , a polycrystalline silicon layer ( epipolysilicon ) , with a layer thickness ranging from a few nanometer to several ten of micrometer , preferably from 10 to 20 m , is created . From this silicon layer , in the final analysis the required structure are etched out and made freely movable by underetching . The previously applied , structured , buried conduction layer make it possible to establish electrical connection between element of the sensor and the outside world , in the form of so-called connection region . These connection region , which are connected via the conductive layer to sensor element , carry a metallizing on their surface . The connection region with the metallizing applied over it serf to secure bonding wire , with which an electrical contact with the structure in the sensor chamber ( sensor structure ) is then to be established . The sensor structure described in DE 195 37 814 A1 is distinguished by the fact that it ha a movable ( free-standing ) region with measurement capacitor , where change in the measuring capacitance upon a deflection are used a a measurement variable . The component of the sensor , all described a example here , will simply be called the foundation wafer , for the sake of simplifying the further description . The foundation wafer must be hermetically tightly joined to the cap wafer in a final machining step . To that end , in the prior art it is provided that a cap be secured above each sensor chamber to the surface of the foundation wafer by mean of a glass solder layer on the cap wafer ( known a the seal-glass solder process ) . A disadvantage of this is that this technology is relatively expensive . The glass solder layer must be applied to the micromechanically structured cap wafer by mean of screen printing . The cap wafer must already be structured on both side to enable the ensuing covering and contacting of the sensor ; that is , the cap wafer itself is already intrinsically expensive . Moreover , this capping technique requires a relatively large amount of space , in which up to about 75 % of the individual element area is required for anchoring the cap to the sensor chip . The resultant structural height and limited structuring option preclude the use of certain especially economical housing for the sensor . Often , the free-standing region covered by the cap of the cap wafer are relatively large . Sensor structure often have edge length of several hundred micrometer . If such a sensor is subjected to a mechanical overload , then in an extreme case , sagging of the cover layer can lead not only to interference with the sensor property but in the final analysis also to an excessive deflection of the sensor structure , to the point of irreversible damage . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention , the disadvantage of the prior art are overcome by the sensor and the method for producing the sensor having the characteristic of the invention . Because in that the covering comprises a first layer ( deposition layer ) that is permeable to an etching medium and the reaction product , and a hermetically sealing second layer ( sealing layer ) located above it , it is possible in term of process technology to dispense with the expensive cap wafer , the conventional screen printing and soldering method , and the large reserve area for glass solder technology , and thus the processing can be completed substantially le expensive overall . Because ( a ) at least the sensor chamber present in the foundation wafer after the establishment of the structure is filled with an oxide , in particular CVD oxide or porous oxide ; ( b ) the sensor chamber is covered by a first layer ( deposition layer ) , in particular of polysilicon , that is transparent to an etching medium and the reaction product or is retroactively made transparent ; ( c ) the oxide in the sensor chamber is removed through the deposition layer with the etching medium ; and ( d ) next , a second layer ( sealing layer ) , in particular of metal or an insulator , is applied to the deposition layer and hermetically seal off the sensor chamber , it is possible to enable structuring of the covering retroactively , via the making and machining method known from semi-conductor technology . By step ( a ) and/or ( b ) , planarizing of the wafer surface can be performed ( for example by CMP , for Chemo-Mechanical Polishing ) . Existing processing problem resulting especially from topography , such a applying and structuring the bond pad ( metallizing ) , are thus circumvented . Compared to the established cap process , the simplified course of the process also produce markedly reduced production cost . The invention thus provides access to a sensor of the generic type and discloses a method for producing the sensor , by which it is possible for the first time to employ capping with a markedly lower structural height for hermetically sealing off sensor chamber in micromechanical structure , so that it is now possible to install them in the aforementioned , especially economical housing . The permeability of the deposition layer for the requisite etching medium and the reaction product produced during the etching can be forced in two different way . First , by anisotropic etching , etching opening can be made in the deposition layer , for instance by the silicon deep etching process patented in German Patent DE 42 41 045 . The size and location of such etching opening can be defined in a very targeted way photolithographically by masking , so that it is possible among other thing to keep any later exposure of the sensor chamber to the hermetically sealing material forming the sealing layer a slight a possible . It is possible to create etching opening that have a diameter of fraction of micrometer up to several micrometer and that can be sealed off in a relatively short time , in a manner to be described below . This is attained for instance by mean of a high aspect ratiothat is , a ratio between the depth and diameter of the etching opening . Second , for the covering , permeable material such a silicon , polysilicon or epipolysilicon , which is already permeable because of the deposition condition or is made permeable by subsequent processing , can be used , at least in some region . An advantageous method for forcing the transparency of the covering is to employ electrochemical etching operation . One such modification of the deposition layer is done in a suitable electrolyte , such a a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol . The silicon of the covering exposed to the etching operation is converted in this process into porous silicon , or in other word it is made porous . Regions of the deposition layer that are not to be made porous can be protected in a known manner by mean of masking layer or suitable doping ( such a n ) . An electrical connection by applying an anodic potential could be done both via the top side and the underside of the deposition layer . In the latter case , the anodic potential is applied to the layer of epipolysilicon located below the deposition layer and forming both the material comprising the sensor structure and the bond frame of the foundation wafer . It is advantageous in this respect that the bond frame can be joined directly electrically to the foundation wafer . An additional electrical connection between the foundation wafer and the covering exists in the form of support element , which can be provided for the sake of mechanically stabilizing the covering . It is thus possible in a simple way to perform the electrical contacting of the deposition layer via the foundation wafer from the back side of the foundation wafer ( back-side contact ) . The etching operation can be additionally reinforced by irradiation in a wavelength range from 100 nm to 1000 nm , in particular between 350 nm and 800 nm . In this way , the machining of the deposition layer can be done especially homogeneously . It is furthermore advantageous , by mean of targeted doping of the deposition layer , to vary the porosity and thus the permeability of the porous silicon . For instance , p-doping is used to create mesoporous pore , while an n-doping can be used to create etching opening with a diameter ranging from a few nanometer up to several micrometer . It ha also proved advantageous to force the permeability of the deposition layer by mean of an also retroactively employed modified stain-etch operation , in which a mixture of hydrofluoric acid , nitric acid and water is employed . The porosity and depth of the etching can be adjusted via an adjustment of the mixture proportion and exposure time . It ha also proved especially advantageous to create the permeability of the deposition layer by mean of a galvanic process , in which a metal layer is applied to the region of the covering that is not to be changed . Simultaneously , the metal layer take on the function of a masking layer and need not necessarily be removed before the later sealing layer is applied . It comprises a metal that is nobler than silicon , in particular such noble metal a platinum and gold . The porosity of the porous ( poly ) silicon created during the galvanic process can be varied a a function of a current density and the electrolyte composition , and in particular via the area ratio of metal to silicon , since the latter represents the galvanic element , that is , the current source . It ha also proved advantageous that support element are provided on the underside of the deposition layer , which establish a mechanically stable connection between the foundation wafer and the covering . If the individual support element or support strut are spaced apart from one another by from several micrometer to several ten of micrometer , then on the one hand excessive sagging of the cover plate upon subjection to an overload is prevented , and on the other , the overall stability is increased substantially . It ha furthermore proved advantageous to structure the sealing layer a well by mean of a masked etching process . The etching process used can also include structuring the deposition layer and optionally even further an upper layer of the foundation wafer , in particular of epipolysilicon . In a further advantageous feature of the method , the pressure inside the sensor chamber can be adjusted by way of the pressure condition that prevail during the deposition of the sealing layer . The process pressure prevailing during the deposition of the sealing layer will automatically become established in the sensor chamber a well and be sealed in there , while the sealing layer is growing . Deposition process that can be considered for the sealing layer are sputtering process ( for metal layer ) or PECVD process ( for SiN , SiO , SiC , etc. ) . If the enclosed pressure should not prove identical to the deposition pressure , additional option still exist . Advantageously , to that end , before or during the deposition the sensor is subjected to an inert gas , in particular helium , at a predetermined temperature that is introduced additionally into the deposition chamber . Because of the permeability of the deposition layer , a delayed pressure equalization can occur , and the fundamental diffusion process can be ascertained empirically . Since the suppression of the pressure equalization is achieved by applying the sealing layer at layer thickness of even only a few micrometer or le , the sealing can be done within relatively short time . Via the aforementioned method step of the invention , capacitive pressure sensor can also be made in an especially simple way . As a common feature , such pressure sensor have a differential capacitor array , which is joined directly or via a coupling element to the covering , so that sagging of the covering cause a change in the capacitance of the differential capacitor array , and this change in turn serf a a measurement variable . Further preferred feature of the invention will become apparent from the other characteristic recited in the dependent claim .

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS . 1-13 illustrate the production method according to the invention for sensor , such a acceleration sensor or rotation rate sensor , and in particular also capacitive pressure sensor . The method step sketched in FIGS . 1-4 are already known from DE 195 37 814 A1 and will therefore be described below only briefly . By definition , a subdivision of the sensor ha already been made into a foundation wafer 11 and a thin-film sensor cap in the form of a covering 13 . The foundation wafer 11 includes all the component necessary for the function of the sensor , and in particular includes contact region to be described in further detail hereinafter , a well a micromechanical structure and electrode . The covering 13 by definition extends from a deposition layer to and including a sealing layer and serf the purpose of hermetically sealing a sensor chamber , in which the micromechanical structure are located . Onto a silicon substrate 10 , an insulation layer 12 , which encloses a conductive layer 14 , is applied . Structuring of the two layer 12 and 14 can be done by known method step used in semiconductor technology , such a lithography and etching process and subsequent etching step . A polycrystalline silicon layer 16 of desired layer thickness is also applied , which cover the insulation layer 12 . The silicon layer 16 typically comprises epipolysilicon , while the conductive layer 14 is shaped of an optionally very highly doped polysilicon ( FIG . 1 ) . By application of a masking layer 18 , a region 20 is defined in which in later method step the micromechanical structure is to be created . First , the region is deepened ( recess 20 ; FIG . 2 ) by a pre-etching step . In an ensuing lithography step ( FIG . 3 ) , the thus-prestructured foundation wafer 11 is coated in the recess 20 with a mask 22 of photoresist , which in advance defines the sensor structure to be made , such a capacitive comb structure , spring , stop , electrode face , and perforation in a seismic mass . What is essential here is that the actual sensor structure be made with an adequately great spacing from the edge of the previously made recess 20 , because there the precision of lithography and resolution are otherwise impaired by the difference in topography . As can be seen from FIG . 4 , in the region not covered by the photoresist 22 , trench 24 , which extend a far a the insulation layer 12 , are made by known , suitable etching process , such a in the manner described in DE 42 41 045 . In this way , individual structure 26 are insulated on the silicon layer 16 . The design of such structure 26since it is knownwill not be addressed in further detail in conjunction with the present description . Next , sacrificial layer etching is done via the trench 24 in the region of the insulation layer 12 , and a void is created ( FIG . 5 ) . The void the trench 24 together form a sensor chamber 28 , in which the structure 26 are accommodated . The sacrificial layer etching can be done for instance via an HF vapor etching process , or dry sacrificial layer etching with silicon a the sacrificial layer in conjunction with a modified layer system . The resist mask 22 wa removed before the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etching . In the case of dry sacrificial layer etching with silicon a the sacrificial layer , the masking layer 18 is removed after the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etching . The entire structure is filled , in the method step sketched in FIG . 6 , with a silicon-based oxide 30 , in particular a CVD oxide or a porous oxide . The preferably highly porous oxide 30 must be removed again at an extremely high etching rate using medium that contain hydrofluoric acid . The deposition condition for the oxide 30 should accordingly be selected such that a low-grade oxide 30 of high porosity is created . These are at the same time the condition of deposition under which deposition is done at the highest possible rate , which ha the advantage of short oxide deposition time . The parameter for designing the deposition condition of such low-grade oxide of high porosity are known from the prior art . For instance by mean of high plasma capacity , the desired oxide film 30 can be deposited during the deposition , at high process pressure and low substrate temperature ( such a 200 C. to 300 C. ) . The next method step includes a re-thinning of the oxide 30 to the height of the silicon layer 16 ( FIG . 7 ) , which can be done for instance by grinding ( CMP or Chemo-Mechanical Polishing ) or a well-known back-etching method . In the exemplary embodiment , the oxide 30 is removed down to the height of the layer 16 . Next , a deposition layer 32 , in particular of polysilicon , is deposited a a deposition layer over the entire surface ( FIG . 8 ) . To avoid compaction of the highly porous oxide 30 , it is advantageous to keep the temperature a low a possible during this deposition . At the usual temperature for polysilicon deposition of 600 C. to 650 C. , for instance , no significant compaction of the oxide 30 yet occurs . As an alternative , it is possible to perform a brief heating of the foundation wafer 11 to temperature of over 1000 C. , without compacting the oxide 30 , if this heating is done only briefly ( for instance for le than 10 minute ) . The tempering of the deposition layer 32 can advantageously be done with the aid of an RTP ( Rapid Thermal Processing ) or RTA ( Rapid Thermal Annealing ) reactor . If epipolysilicon is deposited a the deposition layer 32 , then this deposition can be performed in an epitaxial reactor at a high deposition rate of up to 1 m/min , in order to keep the deposition time short . By mean of such a brief , high temperature treatment of the polysilicon , it can be attained for example that the layer 32 ha a very high intrinsic tensile stress of over 200 MPa/m up to 1 GPa/m of layer thickness , for example , which is quite advantageous for applying the layer 32 a a covering 13 . Because of this high tensile stress , the layer 32 can withstand even a high pressure applied from outside without bulging inward severely . In an ensuing optional process step , the deposition layer 32 can be structured , for instance by etching ( FIG . 9 ) . In the final analysis , then only the region of the foundation wafer 11 among which the micromechanical structure 26 are later to be located inside the sensor chamber 28 will be covered by the deposition layer 32 . It is also possible to use the covering 13 unstructured . In that case , the covering 13 cover the entire wafer surface . The advantage then is that a planar surface of the wafer is preserved . By selective etching of the oxide 30 underneath the deposition layer 32 , it is possible to expose the structure 26 again ( FIG . 10 ) . To that end , the deposition layer 32 must necessarily be permeable to the etching medium used and to the product created during the reaction . For instance , the polysilicon of the deposition layer 32 can be provided for this purpose with small etching opening by targeted etching , in a manner to be described in further detail later herein . Depending on the type of etching process used , etching opening with diameter of 0.1 m to 5 m can be created . As an alternative , the deposition layer 32 can comprise a permeable polysilicon or a polysilicon that is made permeable retroactively by porosification , which allows the etching medium or reaction product to pas through . In conjunction with hydrofluoric acid vapor etching process , this variant ha proved especially advantageous , since the hydrofluoric acid vapor can penetrate polysilicon especially easily , and diffusion event for the specie involved through the polysilicon can be speeded up , especially at elevated temperature . The in-situ permeability of the polysilicon is especially high at low dopant concentration , a long a a long-lasting high-temperature treatment ( tempering ) is avoided . It is also possible to employ a combination of HF liquid-phase etching and HF vapor etching to remove the sacrificial layer . In the wet etching phase ( HF solution ) , the majority of the oxide 30 is first removed . In the ensuing vapor etching , the remainder of the oxide 30 is removed without the risk of sticking , resulting in an overall faster process . After the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etching process , the deposition layer 32 is hermetically closed by deposition of a sealing layer 34 ( FIG . 11 ) . It ha proved especially advantageous to apply a silicon nitride layer a the sealing layer 34 , because that can be deposited at even relatively low temperature of 300 C. to 400 C. in PECVD process . As an alternative , the sealing can also be done by depositing metal , such a aluminum , for which sputtering process are particularly well suited . Depending on the material chosen for the sealing layer 34 , a structuring of the covering 13 can then be done , for instance with the aid of photolithographic process . If the chosen material is a metal ( FIG . 12 ) , then by mean of these structurings the contact pad 36 can simultaneously be formed . In the case of a dielectric material , the sealing layer 34 must be removed completely outside the capping region , and the contact pad 36 are applied ( FIG . 13 ) in a separate method step to the silicon layer 16 or the deposition layer 32 ( if the latter is used unstructured over it full surface ) . The chosen layer thickness of the sealing layer 34 depends essentially on the permeability , porosity , and diameter of the etching opening of the deposition layer 32 , and it is understood that a thicker sealing layer 34 is required for closing the etching opening . FIGS . 14-16 show an alternative process course , beginning with the deposition of the deposition layer 32 a shown in FIG . 8 . First , in the manner already explained , the oxide 30 is etched away through the deposition layer 32 ( FIG . 14 ) . Next , by mean of the sealing layer 34 , the sensor chamber 28 is hermetically sealed ( FIG . 15 ) . Once again , the layer thickness must be selected to suit the property of the deposition layer 32 , which are adjusted for the sake of the passage of the etching medium or reaction product . Next , by a masked etching process shown in FIG . 16 , both the deposition layer 32 and the sealing layer 34 are removed , and the contact pad are applied to the silicon layer 16 in a known manner . Overall , this make it possible to dispense with one mask plane , since the two layer 32 , 34 are structured with one and the same mask . In the case where permeable polysilicon is used a the deposition layer 32 , an adequate resistance must be assured after the structuring to prevent a diffusion of gas via the peripheral region . In practice , it ha been found adequate if the permeable polysilicon layer overlap the epipolysilicon layer 16 by at least 50 m. In a further , already mentioned advantageous embodiment , the structuring of the deposition layer 32 and the cover layer 34 is omitted until or until just before the deposition and structuring of the metal pad 36 ( see FIGS . 32-34 , 34 ) . Not until directly before the deposition of the metallizing 36 is etching of the sealing layer 34 performed , in the immediate region of the bond pad and around them , in order to make the bond region free of insulating layer . In an especially advantageous embodiment , the metal layer 36 for the bond pad simultaneously act a a sealing layer 34 . In this latter case , the sealing layer 34 , after being deposited over the full surface , must be opened again around the bond pad , to enable through-etching of the deposition layer 32 there and thus the creation of electrically insulated contact pad 36 . In a further variant , the epipolysilicon layer 16 is initially not yet etched through in the region of the contact pad 36 , but instead is still present over the full surface . In the production of the sensor structure 26 by anisotropic deep etching , the bond region are accordingly initially not included . Not until the contact pad 36 are etched free , or in other word the deposition layer 32 and the sealing layer 34 , if the latter is not identical with the metallizing layer of the contact pad 36 , are etched through is the epipolysilicon layer 16 etched through , down to the buried oxide 12 , around the bond pad . The same deep etching process can be employed for both the silicon layer 32 and for the epipolysilicon layer 16 . Accordingly a double-trench process take place , in which a first deep trench is made for the sensor structure 26 themselves , and a second deep trench for the bond pad region is made later in the process sequence . In both variant , the electrical connection of the sensor structure 26 is effected via the contact pad 36 through the deposition layer 32 and the layer 16 . The deposition layer 32 must accordingly have adequate electrical conductivity to enable large-area electrical contact , but in practice this is not a problem , given adequate doping , even if the deposition layer 32 are relatively thick . The aforementioned variant can be learned for the sake of illustration from FIGS . 32-34 , in which a metal is used a the seal and bond pad , and FIG . 34 , in which a dielectric is used a a seal and metal is used a the bond pad . The process step , sketched in FIGS . 15 and 11 , in which the sealing layer 34 is applied can be used especially advantageously for adjusting a desired internal pressure inside the sensor chamber 28 . The adjustable pressure range includes pressure from a few microbar up to atmospheric pressure . In contrast to the conventional method , because of the very rapid sealing the tolerance in the pressure adjustment can be kept relatively low . For adjusting the pressure , the procedure can be a follows : In an embodiment with a permeable deposition layer 32 ( one that is in-situ permeable , or is retroactively made porous to create permeability ) , after the foundation wafer 11 , by then fully processed up to the point of the application of the sealing layer 34 , is inserted into a process chamber for deposition of the sealing layer 34 , heating is first done to a temperature between 300 C. and 450 C. ; at the same time , instead of process gas , an inert gas is delivered to the process chamber at a given pressure . As the inert gas , helium is for instance suitable , since it can diffuse especially quickly through the deposition layer 32 that is either in-situ permeable or made permeable by porosification , so that in the sensor a rapid establishment of equilibrium ( internal pressure equal outer pressure ) is possible . Only after that are the process gas required for the deposition of the sealing layer 34 supplied and the deposition plasma ignited . If permeable polysilicon ( in-situ permeable , or made permeable by porosification is used , then only a few second elapse in the time between the leaving behind of the desired concluding pressure in the process chamber and the deposition of an adequately thick sealing layer 34 . For a known layer thickness and permeability of the deposition layer 32 , the pressure change to be expected in this time can be calculated , so that suitable precaution can be planned for . It is also possible initially to leave the deposition pressure at the desired enclosed pressure for the capping , and already to start the deposition process early while still in the presence of the inert gas . Only after the initiation of the deposition process is the chamber pressure readjusted to the pressure range that is actually optimal for the deposition . As a result , while the deposition process proceeds non-optimally for a few second and reach it most favorable operating range only after the pressure adaptation ha been made , still proceeding in this way mean that the time between leaving the capping pressure and the completed hermetic sealing of the sensor element is shortened . For experimentally determining the enclosed pressure and monitoring the method , the diaphragm bulging can be assessed , for instance by interferometry , or quality parameter of the enclosed structure 26 can be ascertained by resonant excitation . Quality control for the method is also easily possible . It ha proved to be especially favorable for this process course to be used to produce surface-micromechanical capacitive pressure sensor . FIGS . 17 and 18 , on the one hand , and 19 and 20 , on the other , accordingly show two possible embodiment of such pressure sensor . First , a shown in FIGS . 17 and 19 , a layer 32 that is permeable or is retroactively made permeable by etching is depositedoptionally in structured formabove the sensor chamber 28 that is filled with the oxide 30 . Subsequent etching out of the oxide 30 and sealing with the sealing layer 34 lead to the application form shown in FIGS . 18 and 20 . In the first case , a torsion rocker 39 is implemented in the pressure sensor ; this rocker is connected to the covering 13 via a coupling element 42 . A seismic mass 38 is suspendedanalogously to a beam scalesymmetrically via torsion spring 40 and centrally with regard to both side . The mask 32 is perforated for the performance of the sacrificial layer etching ; the perforation is not shown here . After the deposition and planarization of the oxide 30 , a hole is made in the oxide 30 , somewhat outside the middle of the torsion rocker 39 , using a photographic technique , and the oxide 30 is etched . Above it , the deposition layer 32 can for instance simply and advantageously be deposited a a permeable polysilicon layer , and/or it can be made permeable retroactively by etching process , such a porosification ; in the contact hole previo sly placed in the oxide 30 the silicon of the rocker 39 can be contacted directly both mechanically and electrically . If an electrical insulation of the sensor diaphragm from the torsion rocker 39 is later desired for instance for the sake of electrical shielding from the environment then before the polysilicon is deposited an insulating layer can be deposited that is not attacked by the HF vapor chemistry employed afterward for sacrificial oxide etching . An example of something suitable for this is a layer of amorphous silicon carbide which is resistant both to medium that contain hydrofluoric acid and to HF vapor . This layer can be structured after the conformal deposition above the contact hole in the oxide either by a masked etching process such that only the coupling element 42 remains or can be machined in such a way that after a grinding process the coupling element 42 remains enclosed by the oxide 30 . It is understood that in that case the order of the process step can also be reversed ; that is the coupling element 42 ( for instance of amorphous silicon carbide ) is applied first and then the filler oxide is deposited and planarized and then the entire covering 13 is deposited and planarized taking into account the pressure adjustment process parameter set beforehand . By the two production variant for the coupling element 42that is simple polysilicon deposition with mechanical connection via the polysilicon which it is understood fill up the contact hole in the oxide 30 and thus establishes the nonpositive engagement with the rocker 39 or the explicit deposition and production of an electrically insulated coupling element 42 by mean of an addition layera mechanical connection is created between the covering 13 and the torsion rocker 39 . Because of the bending form of the covering 13 that is subjected to pressure it is advantageous to place the coupling element 42 between the torsion axis and the center of the cover plate or accordingly for exampleas seen in FIGS . 17 18to the right of the torsion axis of the rocker 39 and to the left of the middle of the diaphragm . If pressure is exerted on the diaphragm a bending line in the form of a double-S ensues which press the right-hand half of the rocker 39 downward and the left-hand half of the rocker 39 accordingly move upward . If there are two counterelectrodes ( structured from the conductive layer 14 ) underneath the rocker 39 then the change in capacitance can be processed a a differential capacitance by mean of suitable evaluation electronics . The electrical wiring of the sensor component is done in the bottom plane through the conductive layer 14 buried there . Such a sensor with the layout described ha an advantageously low temperature drift because of it symmetry and the capacitive assessment by the differential capacitor array making it possible to dispense with an expensive calibration and temperature compensation . If the explicit differential capacitor array is dispensed then a simpler process and design in accordance with FIGS . 19 and 20 can be considered . The seismic mass 44 is joined directly to the deposition layer 32 . Also in the way described above a reference pressure preferably by mean of helium gas can be enclosed in the sensor chamber 28 and the structure can be hermetically sealed by sealing of the sealing layer 34 . If pressure is exerted on the structure the mass 44 is pressed downward thus decreasing the spacing from the layer 14 lying below which function a a counterelectrode and a change in capacitance accordingly ensues . The electrical connection and the embodiment of the counterpart electrode can in turn be accomplished via the layer 14 and extended to the outside . One thus obtains a simple robust capacitive pressure sensor by mean of surface micromechanics . The evaluation electronics developed in standard form for acceleration sensor can continue to be used if a differential capacitor array is embodied by a fixed-value capacitor connected externally to the measuring capacitor . The permeability of the deposition layer 32 for the etching medium and the resultant reaction product can also be forced retroactively after deposition of the layer 32 . A first method of this kind is sketched in FIGS . 21-23 in which an electrochemical etching operation is primarily used for converting silicon into ( permeable ) porous silicon . Firstas already describedthe procedure is the same up to and including the deposition of the deposition layer 32 . Next a suitable masking layer 46 is applied ( FIG . 21 ) and in a known manner such a by an additional lithography step structuring is performed so that a region 48 in which the property of the layer 32 are to be varied or modified is made accessible ( FIG . 22 ) . The actual electrochemical etching operation is performed in the presence of an HF electrolyte such a a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol and lead to the formation of porous structure or etching opening in the region 48 of the layer 32 that are exposed to the electrolyte . It ha proved especially advantageous in the electrochemical etching operation of the type described to perform an irradiation of the surface in addition in a wavelength range from 100 nm to 1000 nm and in particular 350 nm to 800 nm since the homogeneity of the process is improved thereby . An electrical connection by application of an anodic potential can be done on the one hand via the top side of the layer 32 and on the other from the epipolysilicon layer 16 or the foundation wafer 11 ( back-side contact ) via the underside of the layer 32 . The large-area back-side contact via the foundation wafer 11 ha the advantage that with it a better-defined more-homogeneous distribution of current density of the anodizing current is achieved since the current ha to overcome a maximum of only the thickness of the foundation wafer 11 in order to reach the region 48 to be treated . Expediently a high n-doping of the layer of the foundation wafer 11above all the wafer underside of the substrate ( 10 ) is provided ( n++ ) which becomes possible especially simply by POCL deposition and ensuing forcing of phosphorous into the silicon but also by ion implantation of phosphorous arsenic or antimony . The n++ doping of the back side of the foundation wafer 11 reduces the Schottky barrier that is present in the electrolyte/silicon contact region . Suitably adapted doping of the layer 32 in the region 48 that is to be varied can be used to control the process . It ha been demonstrated for instance that p-doping lead to the formation of mesoporous pore while n-doping lead to etching opening ranging from a few ten of nanometer to micrometer . Alternatively to the electrochemical etching operation the procedure can be a shown in FIGS . 24-27 for exemplary embodiment . First the still inadequately permeable layer 32 is applied and next using known masking method a metal layer is deposited and structured . In the ensuing galvanic production of porous polysilicon in the region 48 the metal thus simultaneously take on the function both of masking the silicon surface of the layer 32 in the region that are not to be electrochemically anodized and of a cathode in the galvanic silicon/electrolyte/metal cell . The process that lead to the formation of the porous polysilicon can be controlled via the composition of the HF electrolyte and via the incident current density in this galvanic cell . The current density are dependent on the ratio of area of metal to silicon . The larger the metal area the higher the current density . Typical metal to silicon area ratio are between 10 and 20 to 1 . The advantage of this technique is that electrical contacting of the wafer is not necessary . To achieve these ratio part of the metal face of the region 48 which is to be made porous of the covering 13 can be covered with a grid . Care should be taken that the width of the metal track is greater than the thickness of the layer 32 to be etched because otherwise excessive underetching and detachment of the metal could occur . A selection among possible embodiment can be learned from the plan view and sectional view of FIGS . 24-27 . It is also conceivable by a modified stain-etch operation to treat the region 48 that are to be made porous with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid nitric acid and water . All the other region must be protected with a suitable masking layer for instance of silicon nitride . By way of the composition and in particular the nitric acid concentration and the exposure time the porosity and layer thickness of the modified porous silicon region can be controlled . Moreover there is an empirically detectable influence of dopants making it possible to control the process that creates the porosity . A further alternative embodiment of the thin-film sensor cap in which support element 50 are present on the underside of the deposition layer 32 can be seen in FIGS . 28-31 . Up to the deposition of the oxide 30 a shown in FIG . 6 the method described at the outset can be employed . However a complete planarization of the oxide film 30 down to the height of the epipolysilicon layer 16 is dispensed with . Instead a structured removal of material is done in which the oxide 30 is removed from those region that are later to form the support element 50 . These region are logically located above the region of the epipolysilicon layer 16 which are not supposed to be further attacked in the ensuing etching process . The individual support element 50 are typically encompassing support strut or support column which thus define the sensor chamber 28 that is covered by the covering 13 . The necessary micromechanical structure 26 are located inside the sensor chamber 28 . In accordance with FIG . 28 slight spacing of the support element 50 and thus slight clamping width of the covering 13 can be achieved . Clamping width below 10 m are thus feasible . However this also mean reduced sagging upon subjection to an overpressure and the spacing of the covering 13 and the sensor element can be reduced so much that it is impossible to lift the sensor structure 26 out in the event of a mechanical overload . Since the bond frame necessary in the conventional sensor can be drastically reduced in size a major reduction in surface area additional ensues so that more than twice a many acceleration sensor can be processed on the same foundation wafer 11 . FIG . 31 in this respect show a further advantageous embodiment with T-shaped support element 50 which lead to especially stable structure . For the case where instead of using a permeable polysilicon a the deposition layer 32 etching opening 52 by way of which the sacrificial oxide etching take place are to be made retroactively the design shown in FIG . 2 ha proved advantageous . The etching opening 52 are disposed here such that upon the deposition of the sealing layer 34 at most the structural element 53 of the sensor that are not fundamental to it function are exposed to the deposition plasma . These structural element 53 that are not fundamental to the function are in fact precisely those element that are connected to the support element 50 . After the sacrificial etching it is optionally possible via the etching opening 52 to deposit suitable anti-adhesion layer in the region of the structure 26 a well . A sensor in accordance with FIG . 30 can be made with the aid of the process step described above . Along with the possibility described in conjunction with FIGS . 15 and 16 of simultaneously structuring both the deposition layer 32 and the layer 34 or of initially not structuring the deposition layer 32 and initially leaving it over the full surface and only at the end etching contact pad 36 that are electrically insulated from the system it is also possible to machine the epipolysilicon layer 16 located beneath so that the opening 54 by way of which contacting can later be done can be created in one process step . In electrochemical etching contacting in turn occurs via the back side of the wafer . The layer are then electrically connected via the support element 50 so that a preferably high permeability is established in the region of the support element 50 by the formation of porous silicon . This electrical contacting of the layer 32 can also be done next to the sensor region 28 toward the substrate 10 . ''"

Description RELATED APPLICATIONS This patent is a continuation-in-part of , and claim priority to , the U.S. patent application bearing Ser . No . 10/351,013 now U.S. Pat . No . 6,891,746 , which is a divisional application of a U.S. patent application bearing Ser . No . 09/963,171 now issued a U.S. Pat . No . 6,576,969 B2 . BACKGROUND A memory chip generally comprises a plurality of memory cell that are deposited onto a silicon wafer and addressable via an array of column conducting lead ( bit line ) and row conducting lead ( word line ) . Typically , a memory cell is situated at the intersection of a bit line and a word line . The memory cell are controlled by specialized circuit that perform function such a identifying row and column from which data are read from or to which data are written . Typically , each memory cell store data in the form of a 1 or a 0 , representing a bit of data . An array of magnetic memory cell can be referred to a a magnetic random access memory or MRAM . MRAM is generally nonvolatile memory ( i.e. , a solid state chip that retains data when power is turned off ) . At least one type of magnetic memory cell includes a data layer and a reference layer , separated from each other by at least one intermediate layer . The data layer may also be referred to a a bit layer , a storage layer , or a sense layer . In a magnetic memory cell , a bit of data ( e.g. , a 1 or 0 ) may be stored by writing into the data layer via one or more conducting lead ( e.g. , a bit line and a word line ) . A typical data layer might be made of one or more ferromagnetic material . The write operation is typically accomplished via one or more write current that set the orientation of the magnetic moment in the data layer to a predetermined direction ( hereinafter magnetic orientation ) . Once written , the stored bit of data may be read by providing a read current through one or more conducting lead ( e.g. , a read line ) to the magnetic memory cell . For each memory cell , the magnetic orientation of the data layer and the reference layer are either parallel ( in the same direction ) or anti-parallel ( in different direction ) to each other . The degree of parallelism affect the resistance of the cell , and this resistance can be determined by sensing ( e.g. , via a sense amplifier ) an output current or voltage produced by the memory cell in response to the read current . More specifically , if the magnetic orientation are parallel , the resistance determined based on the output current is of a first relative value ( e.g. , relatively low ) . If the magnetic orientation are anti-parallel , the resistance determined is of a second relative value ( e.g. , relatively high ) . The relative value of the two state ( i.e. , parallel and anti-parallel ) are typically different enough to be sensed distinctly . A 1 or a 0 may be assigned to the respective relative resistance value depending on design specification . The intermediate layer , which may also be referred to a a spacer layer , may comprise insulating material ( e.g. , dielectric ) , non-magnetic conducting material , and/or other known material . The various conducting lead which are used to address the memory cell ( e.g. , bit line , word line , and read line ) , and to provide current to pas through the data and reference layer to read data from or write data to the memory cell are provided by one or more additional layer , called conducting layer ( s ) . The layer described above and their respective characteristic are typical of magnetic memory cell based on tunneling magnetoresistance ( TMR ) effect known in the art . Other combination of layer and characteristic may also be used to make magnetic memory cell based on TMR effect . Still other configuration of magnetic memory cell are based on other well known physical effect ( e.g. , giant magnetoresistance ( GMR ) , anisotropic magnetoresistance ( AMR ) , colossal magnetoresistance ( CMR ) , and/or other physical effect ) . Throughout this application , various exemplary embodiment will be described in reference to the TMR memory cell a first described above . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the exemplary embodiment may also be implemented with other type of magnetic memory cell known in the art ( e.g. , other type of TMR memory cell , GMR memory cell , AMR memory cell , CMR memory cell , etc . ) according to the requirement of a particular implementation . The relative resistance between a reference layer and a data layer of a magnetic memory cell may be more efficiently and definitively ascertained if the magnetic orientation of the reference layer can be pinned-on-the-fly ( i.e. , by applying a current to pin the reference layer to a known magnetic orientation when one wish to read a bit ) . Various exemplary embodiment of pinned-on-the-fly reference layer are described in more detail in U.S. Pat . No . 6,404,674 , issued to Anthony et al . and assigned to the assignee of the present application . This patent is hereby incorporated by reference for all purpose . One way to make magnetic memory cell with reference layer that can be pinned-on-the-fly is to make the reference layer magnetically soft ( i.e. , layer whose magnetic orientation is easy to switch ) . Thus , a market exists for magnetic memory cell having reference layer whose magnetic orientation is easy to switch .

Magnetic Memory Cells Having Soft Reference Layers A. Overview of Soft Magnetic Behavior A layer of magnetic material is said to exhibit soft magnetic behavior when it magnetic orientation can be reversibly switched by a small magnetic field . A layer of magnetic material may be soft a a result of it chemical composition , size , shape , or even the temperature of the material during measurement . A superparamagnetic material is one example of a magnetic material that can be ultra-soft . An ultra-soft material generally ha no set magnetic orientation when no magnetic field is being applied . The ultra-soft material ha extremely low coercivity and may only require a very small amount of magnetic field to switch it magnetic orientation one way or another . B . Applying Soft Magnetic Materials to Magnetic Memory Cells Soft magnetic material are useful in magnetic memory cell to improve switching characteristic of the memory cell . For example , a soft data layer generally requires a lower switching current than a hard data layer during a write operation . However , the data layer should not be too soft . It is desirable to make the data layer hard enough to retain the magnetic orientation written into the layer . Many us of the soft magnetic material in magnetic memory cell have been disclosed in U.S. Pat . No . 6,404,674 ( issued to Anthony et al . ) and U.S. Pat . No . 6,538,917 ( issued to Tran et al . ) , which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purpose . C. Applying Soft Magnetic Materials to Reference Layers in Magnetic Memory Cells In a magnetic memory cell implementing a soft reference layer ( a opposed to a pinned or hard reference layer ) , the coercivity of the reference layer is typically much lower than the coercivity of the data layer . For example , in many exemplary magnetic memory cell , the coercivity of the data layer might be 2-5 time greater than the coercivity of the reference layer . When implementing a soft reference layer in a magnetic memory cell , the reference layer can be set into a known magnetic orientation with small magnetic field generated by current provided by conductor adjacent to the magnetic memory cell . Such current are lower than the switching current needed to write a bit in the data layer . Lower current consumption may result in reduced operating power . D. Making a Reference Layer Soft by Reducing Its Magnetic Energy In a magnetically soft layer , very small magnetic field ( or current ) can cause the magnetic orientation in the layer to change direction . If used appropriately , this attribute can be desirable in the reference layer . Generally , a magnetic material is rendered soft by reducing it magnetic energy , which is proportional to K , the sum of all anisotropy of the magnetic layer ( typically anisotropy includes , without limitation , shape anisotropy , magnetocrystalline anisotropy , and magnetoelastic anisotropy ) . When magnetic element are patterned to sub-micrometer dimension , shape anisotropy often dominates , so controlling shape anisotropy is important in creating a soft , patterned magnetic element . 1 . Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Shape Anisotropy When designing a soft reference layer , one may consider making a layer with a small shape anisotropy . In general , the smaller the difference between major and minor ax of a planar shape , the smaller the shape anisotropy . For example , a circle , whose major and minor ax are equal to it diameter d , ha no shape anisotropy . A square of width d ha a smaller shape anisotropy than a rectangle of width d. As the dimension of a layer become smaller , the shape anisotropy ( Ks ) of an elongated shape increase rapidly . Thus , reducing shape anisotropy ( e.g. , by adapting circular shape ) is especially beneficial for small patterned layer . 2 . Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Choice of ferromagnetic alloy can also be an important consideration when creating a soft reference layer . The magnetic field required to saturate the magnetization along an applied field axis is generally proportional to the magnetic anisotropy . Therefore , implementing low magnetocrystalline anisotropy in a soft reference layer may allow the magnetization of the soft reference layer to respond to lower magnetic field . Larger field are necessary to alter magnetization orientation in higher anisotropy material . Examples of material having low magnetocrystalline anisotropy include NiFe , CoFe , and amorphous ferromagnetic alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) . 3 . Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Volume As the volume V of a patterned magnetic layer is reduced , the total magnetic energy , KV , of the layer decrease and eventually approach the thermal energy , kBT , of the layer . Here kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature . When the ratio of magnetic energy to thermal energy ( KV/kBT ) in a layer of material is le than a threshold value ( e.g. , about 50 ) , the layer of material may become le thermally stable and it magnetic orientation may become susceptible to reorientation due to thermal fluctuation . One manifestation of the onset of thermal instability is a reduction in coercivity , which can be used to advantage in a soft-reference layer . Further reduction of the volume of a layer ( e.g. , reducing the ratio between KV and kBT to about 5 ) , may place the layer in a superparamagnetic , ultra-soft , state . Prior to reaching the superparamagnetic state , thermal energy may facilitate switching of magnetic orientation , making the layer softer . Based on the foregoing , reducing the volume of a layer ( e.g. , by reducing it area and/or thickness ) may be considered in the design of a soft reference layer . Patterning the soft reference layer into a thinner layer ( especially in combination with a small circular shape ) may make the reference layer ultra-soft . Of course , one can also use any combination of the above technique to create a soft reference layer depending on the specific requirement of a particular implementation . Sections III-V below illustrate exemplary magnetic memory cell applying one or more of the above technique to reduce magnetic energy in the reference layer and render it magnetically soft . Sections VI-VIII below describe process for making those exemplary magnetic memory cell . E. What About the Data Layer ? The data layer may be patterned differently than the reference layer so that the data layer may maintain it magnetic hardness by , for example , having a larger shape anisotropy or volume . This may be desirable to ensure that the data layer will retain it magnetic orientation once written . III . A First Exemplary Memory Cell FIG . 1 illustrates an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 100 having a soft reference layer . Generally , a memory cell may be made a top-pinned ( where the reference layer is on top of the data layer ) or bottom-pinned ( where the reference layer is below the data layer ) . For ease of explanation , only the top-pinned configuration is shown in FIG . 1 and referenced in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein . However , this configuration is merely illustrative . Thus , one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other configuration ( e.g. , bottom-pinned , etc . ) may also be implemented using the exemplary process disclosed herein in accordance with any particular design requirement . The memory cell 100 includes a data layer 110 , a spacer layer 120 , and a reference layer 130 . The reference layer 130 ha a lower magnetic energy than the data layer 110 . The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor ( not shown ) that are orthogonal to each other and are collectively used for both write and read operation . In some implementation , one or more conductor may also be considered a a part of the magnetic memory cell 100 . One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration a illustrated in FIG . 1 is merely illustrative . Other configuration , for example , configuration having additional layer are also known in the art . For example , another magnetic memory cell configuration may also include a seed layer , a protective cap layer , and/or other layer . The seed layer generally enhances crystalline alignment of other nearby ferromagnetic layer ( s ) . Exemplary material for a seed layer include Ta , Ru , NiFe , Cu , or combination of these material . The protective cap layer protects the data layer 110 from the environment ( e.g. , by reducing oxidation of the data layer 110 ) and may be formed using any suitable material known in the art , for example , Ta , TaN , Cr , Al or Ti . For ease of explanation , these additional layer are not shown in the Figures ; however , magnetic memory cell having one or more of these additional layer may be implemented with various embodiment to be described herein in accordance with a particular design choice . The data layer 110 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material . In an exemplary embodiment , ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 110 include , without limitation , NiFe , NiFeCo , CoFe , amorphous alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) , and still other material . The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material , or multiple layer separated by non-magnetic layer . In an exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 120 is a tunnel barrier layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 100 is a TMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 120 may be made of SiOx , SiNx , MgO , AlOx , AlNx , TaOx , and/or other insulating material . In another exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 120 is a non-magnetic conducting layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 100 is a GMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 120 may be made of Cu , Au , Ag , and/or other non-magnetic conducting material . The reference layer 130 may comprise a single layer of material or multiple layer of material . For example , the reference layer 130 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material . In an exemplary embodiment , ferromagnetic material suitable for the reference layer 130 include NiFe , NiFeCo , CoFe , amorphous ferromagnetic alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) , and other material . The reference layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material , or multiple layer separated by non-magnetic layer . In an exemplary implementation , the data layer 110 is thicker ( and thus ha a greater volume ) than the reference layer 130 . The magnetization state of such a data layer 110 would be more thermally stable than a reference layer 130 of the same cross-sectional area and made of the same material . More generally , the data layer and the reference layer may be made of the same or different material and size . In an exemplary implementation , the data layer 110 , spacer 120 , and the reference layer 130 are patterned to a circular , or a low aspect ratio oval , elliptical , and/or other rounded shape that provides a relatively smaller shape anisotropy for the reference layer 130 and the data layer 110 . In this implementation , the aspect ratio , defined a length divided by width , can be le than 2 . If the volume of reference layer is made sufficiently small through a combination of small planar area and film thickness , then the reference layer can become superparamagnetic . In this case the reference layer magnetization can be oriented by a very small magnetic field . In an exemplary implementation , the data layer 110 ha a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy than the reference layer 130 , thereby rendering the data layer 110 magnetically harder . Hence , one level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization in the reference layer , and another higher level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization of the data layer . An exemplary process for making the memory cell 100 will be described in Section VI below . IV . A Second Exemplary Magnetic Memory Cell FIG . 2 illustrates an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 200 . The magnetic memory cell 200 includes a larger volume ( e.g. , wider and thicker ) data layer 210 relative to the soft reference layer 230 . This configuration may provide a more magnetically stable data layer 210 and may reduce the effect of the fringe demagnetizing field emanating from the edge of the data layer 210 from affecting the switching magnetic field of the reference layer 230 . Typically , fringe demagnetizing field from one layer will increase the required switching magnetic field of another layer . However , an offset at the edge between the layer ( e.g. , making one layer slightly smaller than the other ) may reduce the effect of fringe demagnetizing field from the larger layer on the smaller layer . For ease of explanation , only the top-pinned configuration is shown in FIG . 2 and referenced to in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein . One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration a illustrated in FIG . 2 is merely illustrative . Other configuration , for example , configuration having additional conductor ( s ) and/or configuration having other additional layer are also known in the art . For ease of explanation , additional layer are not shown in the Figure ; however , magnetic memory cell having one or more additional layer may be implemented with various embodiment to be described herein in accordance with a particular design choice . Further , a person skilled in the art will readily recognize that the shape of the layer 210-230 in a memory cell are merely illustrative . The shape at which a layer is being patterned depends upon the masking process . Thus , during a particular masking process , the shape of one or more layer in the memory cell may be made different than another layer of the memory cell by applying an additional etching step ( e.g. , plasma etching , wet etching , etc . ) to etch such one or more layer and/or a heating step to cause the mask layer to change shape ( e.g. , by causing reflow of the mask layer material ) before resuming etch of such one or more layer . Returning now to FIG . 2 , the memory cell 200 includes a data layer 210 , a spacer layer 220 , and a reference layer 230 . The reference layer 230 ha a lower magnetic energy than the data layer 210 . The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor ( not shown ) that are orthogonal to each other and are collectively used for both write and read operation . The data layer 210 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material . In an exemplary embodiment , ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 210 include , without limitation , NiFe , NiFeCo , CoFe , amorphous alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) , and still other material . The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material , or multiple layer separated by non-magnetic layer . In an exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 220 is a tunnel barrier layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 200 is a TMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 220 may be made of SiOx , SiNx , MgO , AlOx , AlNx , TaOx , and/or other insulating material . In another exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 220 is a non-magnetic conducting layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 200 is a GMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 220 may be made of Cu , Au , Ag , and/or other non-magnetic conducting material : The reference layer 230 may comprise a single layer of material or multiple layer of material . For example , the reference layer 230 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material . In an exemplary embodiment , ferromagnetic material suitable for the reference layer 230 include NiFe , NiFeCo , CoFe , amorphous ferromagnetic alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) , and other material . The reference layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material , or multiple layer separated by non-magnetic layer . In an exemplary implementation , the data layer 210 ha a larger planar area than the reference layer 230 . The magnetization state of such a data layer 210 would be more thermally stable than a soft reference layer 230 of the same thickness and made of the same material . While FIG . 2 indicates that spacer layer 220 and reference layer 230 have the same shape , it is not necessary to the design of the memory cell . One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the size and shape of the spacer layer 220 and the reference layer 230 can vary depending on design choice . In an exemplary implementation , the spacer layer 220 and the reference layer 230 are patterned to a circular , or a low aspect ratio ( e.g. , le than 2 ) oval , elliptical , and/or other shape that provides a relatively smaller shape anisotropy for the reference layer 230 . The data layer 210 is patterned to an oval , elliptical , rectangular , and/or other shape that ha a larger planar area than the reference layer 230 . If the volume of reference layer is made sufficiently small through a combination of small planar area and film thickness , then the reference layer can become superparamagnetic . In this case the reference layer magnetization can be oriented by a very small magnetic field . In an exemplary implementation , data layer 210 ha a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy than reference layer 230 , thereby rendering data layer 210 magnetically harder . Hence , one level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization in the reference layer , and another higher level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization of the data layer . An exemplary process for making the memory cell 200 will be described in Section VII below . V. A Third Exemplary Magnetic Memory Cell FIG . 3 illustrates an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 300 . The magnetic memory cell 300 includes a larger volume ( e.g. , larger planar area ) data layer 310 relative to the soft reference layer 330 . This configuration may provide a more magnetically stable data layer 310 and may reduce the effect of the fringe demagnetizing field emanating from the edge of the data layer 310 from affecting the switching magnetic field of the reference layer 330 . For ease of explanation , only the top-pinned configuration is shown in FIG . 3 and referenced to in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein . One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration a illustrated in FIG . 3 is merely illustrative . Other configuration , for example , configuration having additional conductor ( s ) and/or configuration having other additional layer are also known in the art . For ease of explanation , additional layer are not shown in the Figure ; however , magnetic memory cell having one or more additional layer may be implemented with various embodiment to be described herein in accordance with a particular design choice . Referring now to FIG . 3 , the memory cell 300 includes a data layer 310 , a spacer layer 320 , and a reference layer 330 . The reference layer 330 ha a lower magnetic energy than the data layer 310 . The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor ( not shown ) that are orthogonal to each other and are collectively used for both write and read operation . The data layer 310 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material . In an exemplary embodiment , ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 310 include , without limitation , NiFe , NiFeCo , CoFe , amorphous alloy ( e.g. , CoFeB , CoZrNb ) , and still other material . The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material , or multiple layer separated by non-magnetic layer . In an exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 320 is a tunnel barrier layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 300 is a TMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 320 may be made of SiOx , SiNx , MgO , AlOx , AlNx , TaOx , and/or other insulating material . In another exemplary embodiment , the spacer layer 320 is a non-magnetic conducting layer ( e.g. , if the memory cell 300 is a GMR memory cell ) . In this embodiment , the spacer layer 320 may be made of Cu , Au , Ag , and/or other non-magnetic conducting material .

These small dot may have a shape anisotropy that is smaller than a single layer , for example , a compared to the reference layer a shown in FIGS . 1 and 2 . The spacer layer 320 and data layer 310 are patterned to an oval , elliptical , rectangular , and/or other shape that give the data layer 310 a larger shape anisotropy than the reference layer 330 . If the volume of reference layer is made sufficiently small ( e.g. , by a combination of small planar area and film thickness ) , then the reference layer can become superparamagnetic . In this case the reference layer magnetization can be oriented by a very small magnetic field . An exemplary process for making the memory cell 300 will be described in Section VIII below . VI .

That is , recessed or stepped portion are formed by the above-described patterning processing for the aluminum wiring . However , these recessed or stepped portion can be concealed by the SOG layer 32 . Laminating the second TEOS film 33 on the SOG layer 32 surely provides a flat and smooth surface . A light-shielding film 34 , formed by an aluminum-group ( e.g. , AlSi ) metallic film , is formed at a predetermined light-shielding region on the surface of the flat second TEOS film 33 . The light-shielding film 34 ha a film thickness of approximately 1.3 m. In this embodiment , the predetermined light-shielding region corresponds to the surface of signal processing circuit element including the IIL element 5 and the bipolar transistor 6 . The electrode pattern 29 for the electrode pad 8 is formed by using AlSi simultaneously with the formation of the light-shielding film 34 . The light-shielding film 34 is electrically connected to the p+ type separate diffusion region 3 at a predetermined portion 34 b via an aluminum electrode 28 a . Thus , the light-shielding film 34 is identical in electrical potential with the substrate 1 . A protecting film 35 , e.g. , an SiN film , is formed on the surface of the light-shielding film 34 . The protecting film 35 ha a film thickness of approximately 1.6 m. The protecting film 35 is not provided on the electrode pattern 29 . Thus , the electrode pattern 29 is in an uncovered condition . None of the light-shielding film 34 and the protecting film 35 are provided on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 . Thus , the anti-reflection film 30 is directly exposed to the incoming light . FIG . 1 is a plan view showing a schematic arrangement of the above-described photo sensing integrated circuit . The photo diode 4 is disposed at a center of the substrate 1 . The photo diode 4 is surrounded by an element arranging region 36 for accommodating the signal processing circuit element including the IIL element 5 and the bipolar transistor 6 . The upper surface of the element arranging region 36 is covered by the above-described light-shielding film 34 . The light-shielding film 34 overhang the element arranging region 36 so a to extend from an edge of the element arranging region 36 by a predetermined distance . The light-shielding film 34 is provided with an opening 34 a for uncovering the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 . A plurality of electrode pad 8 , electrically connected to various circuit element disposed in the element arranging region 36 , are positioned at a region not covered by the light-shielding film 34 on an outer peripheral portion of the substrate 1 . In the same manner , the thin-film resistor 27 and the aluminum electrode pattern 37 a and 37 b electrically connected to this thin-film resistor 27 are disposed outside the light-shielding film 34 . Next , a manufacturing method of the above-described photo sensing integrated circuit will be explained . First , n-type embedded layer 9 , 14 and 21 are formed on the p type silicon substrate 1 having a surface azimuth ( 100 ) . Then , diffusion embedding is performed a a preparation for forming the p+ type separate diffusion region 3 . Subsequently , the n type epitaxial layer 2 is formed on the substrate 1 . Then , the p+ type separate diffusion region 3 is formed by performing the separate diffusing for forming the element forming region 4 a , 5 a , 6 a , 7 a and 8 a . The impurity is doped into each element forming region by selectively performing the diffusion . In this case , the photo diode 4 and the IIL 5 have manufacturing process commonly performed . For example , the n+ type diffusion region 10 and 11 of the photo diode 4 can be simultaneously formed with the n+ type diffusion region 15 and 16 of the IIL 5 . Regarding other diffusion region , the ordinary IC manufacturing process can be used for doping the impurity . After forming the diffusion region of the above-described element , the p+ type diffusion region 12 of the photo diode 4 is formed by using an ion-implantation method . The p+ type impurity having a predetermined density are doped at a predetermined depth to form a p-n junction . Next , to form the thin-film resistor 27 , a CrSi layer is coated on the oxide film 26 formed on the surface of the substrate 1 by sputtering etc . The coated CrSi layer is configured into a predetermined shape by using photolithographic patterning . Subsequently , a required number of opening are formed at predetermined portion on the oxide film 26 by using the photolithographic patterning . Then , an aluminum ( or AlSi ) layer of approximately 1.1 m is coated by sputtering etc . The coated aluminum layer is shaped into the predetermined electrode pattern 28 by using a photolithographic patterning . In this case , no etching is applied to the aluminum left on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 . The remaining aluminum act a a protector for the anti-reflection film 30 . Therefore , the anti-reflection film 30 is not damaged during succeeding manufacturing process . At the final manufacturing step , this aluminum layer is removed off the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 . Next , a an insulating film used for the flattening processing , the first TEOS film 31 having a film thickness of approximately 200 nm is formed by using a CVD method . The SOG layer 32 , e.g. , BPSG ( Boron-Phosphor-Silicate Glass ) , is applied on the first TEOS film 31 to smoothen the recessed or stepped portion . Then , the second TEOS film 33 having a film thickness of approximately 700 nm is formed on the SOG layer 32 by using a CVD method . With the formation of these laminated insulating layer , the recessed or stepped portion formed during the aluminum wiring pattern can be flattened so a to leave a smooth surface . Thereafter , an opening corresponding to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 is provided on each of the first TEOS film 31 and the second TEOS film 33 . The aluminum coating applied to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 is exposed through this opening . Then , the light-shielding film 34 of AlSi having a film thickness of approximately 1.3 m is coated on the second TEOS film 33 by sputtering . Then , a photolithographic patterning is applied on the light-shielding film 34 so a to form the opening 34 a corresponding to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 and expose the electrode pad 8 and the thin-film resistor 27 ( refer to FIG . 1 ) . Thus , the patterned light-shielding film 34 cover or conceals the element arranging region 36 . Next , the protecting film 35 of SiN having a film thickness of approximately 1.6 m is formed on the light-shielding film 34 by using a CVD method . Then , a photolithographic patterning is applied on the protecting film 35 . More specifically , the SiN film 35 is removed off the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 and from the electrode pad 8 by applying dry etching . Finally , the aluminum coating left on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 is removed off by etching . The manufactured photo sensing integrated circuit device ( hereinafter , referred to a chip ) is then subjected to an electric output performance check and adjustment . More specifically , a laser beam is irradiated on a planar pattern ( refer to FIG . 1 ) of the thin-film resistor 27 to perform predetermined trimming processing . The thin-film resistor 27 is trimmed by partly burning and cutting the thin-film resistor 27 . Preferably , a YAG laser may be used for forming a cutout T on the thin-film resistor 27 , a a rough adjustment a shown in FIG . 1 . The cutout T extends from an edge of the thin-film resistor 27 inward in a lateral direction . And , after advancing a predetermined distance , the cutout T turn perpendicularly to a longitudinal direction of the thin-film resistor 27 . During the cutting operation , the electric performance of the chip is monitored . The size of the cutout T is adjusted in accordance with the monitored value so a to obtain desirable characteristic . In the above-described chip , the light-shielding film 34 is formed by an aluminum-group metallic film . Thus , a capacitance coupling is formed between the light-shielding film 34 and the aluminum wiring pattern 28 a shown in FIG . 3 . This possibly cause an error in operation due to a parasitic capacitance . According to this embodiment , the light-shielding film 34 is electrically connected to the substrate 1 at the predetermined portion 34 b via the aluminum electrode pattern 28 a . With this arrangement , the light-shield film 34 is equalized in electrical potential with the substrate 1 . This is effective to eliminate any adverse influence given from an electric power source voltage or from extraneous noise etc . Furthermore , setting the electrical potential of the light-shielding film 34 and the substrate 1 to a ground potential is effective in that the light-shielding film 34 can function a an electric shielding film . This provides a stabilized detecting operation . The silicon substrate 1 , used in this embodiment , ha a surface azimuth defined by ( 100 ) because the performance of the photo diode 4 can be improved .

Thus , the light-shielding ability can be assured in the element arranging region 36 . Sixth , a the light-shielding film 34 is electrically connected to the substrate 1 , no malfunction will be caused due to the parasitic capacitance formed between the light-shielding film 34 and the aluminum wiring pattern 28 .
