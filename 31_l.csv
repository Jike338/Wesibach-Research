TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relate to semiconductor process method of form a plurality of capacitor on a substrate, bit line contact and method of form bit line contact. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Circuit device fabricate on or over semiconductor wafer typically undergo one or more photolithographic step during formation. During such photolithographic step, device feature can be etch use conventional technique. The space between such device be important because often time adjacent device must be electrically isolate from one another to avoid unwanted electrical interconnection. One of the limitation on device space stem from limitation inherent in the photolithographic process itself. In the prior art, device be generally space only as close as the photolithographic limit will permit. By way of example and refer to FIGS. 1 and 2, a semiconductor wafer fragment 25 include a substrate 29 atop which a material 28 be provide. A plurality of patterned mask layer 26 be form atop the material 28. Referring to FIG. 3, the material 28 be anisotropically etch through the patterned masking layer 26 to form line 30 atop the substrate 29. As show, individual line 30 have respective width L1 which constitute the minimum photolithographic feature size available for a line. Typically, a separation S1 separate adjacent line 30 across the substrate as show. Such dimension be typically only slightly large than L1 but could be the same as L1. The term pitch as use herein be intend to be in its conventional usage, and be define as the distance between one edge of a device and the corresponding same edge of the next adjacent device. Accordingly and in the illustrated example, the pitch P1 between adjacent line 30( i.e., from the left illustrate edge of one line 30 to the left illustrate edge of the next immediately adjacent line 30) be equal to the sum of L1 and S1. As integrated circuitry get small and denser, the need to reduce space dimension or pitch, such as S1 and P1, become increasingly important. This invention grow out of the need to reduce the size of integrated circuit, and particularly the need to reduce space dimension and pitch between adjacent device over a semiconductor wafer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention include semiconductor processing method and relate integrated circuitry in which a plurality of patterned device outline be form over a semiconductor substrate. Electrically it insulative partition or spacers be then form on at least a portion of the patterned device outline, after which a plurality of substantially identically shaped device be form relative to the pattern device outline. Individual form device be space from at least one other of the device by a distance substantially no more than a width of one of the electrically insulative spacers. According to one aspect of the invention, capacitor be form. In one embodiment, a pair of adjacent capacitor container be form over a substrate by etch a first capacitor container open have at least one sidewall. An electrically insulative spacer be form over the sidewall. A second capacitor container opening be etch selectively relative to the spacer. Capacitors be then form in the capacitor container in a manner such that adjacent capacitor have a separation distance which be substantially no great than the width of the spacer between the adjacent capacitor. In one aspect, a bit line contact be form. The bit line contact be form as an opening that extend through a layer form on a substrate to a node on the substrate. A first dielectric sidewall be form in the opening and coat an interior sidewall of the opening.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This disclosure of the invention be submit in furtherance of the constitutional purpose of the U.S. Patent Laws to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts( Article 1, Section 8). Referring initially to FIGS. 4 and 5, a plurality of patterned device outline 32 be photolithographically form over a semiconductive substrate 34. As used herein, the term semiconductive substrate be define to mean any construction comprise semiconductive material, include, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive material such as a semiconductive wafer( either alone or in assembly comprise other material thereon), and semiconductive material layer( either alone or in assembly comprise other material). The term substrate refers to any supporting structure, include, but not limited to, the semiconductive substrate describe above. In this illustrated example, the material constitute outline 32 may be of the type which can be etch selectively relative to the substrate 34. Such outline define area over the substrate 34 in which conductive line be to be form. Such patterned device outline be, dimension-wise, substantially the same as those set forth with regard to the pattern masking layer 26 illustrate in FIGS. 1-3. Referring to FIG. 6, an electrically insulative material such as SiO2 or Si3N4 be form over the line 32 and the substrate 34 and be subsequently anisotropically etch to provide a plurality of sidewall spacers 36 on at least a portion, and possibly all, of the pattern device outline 32. For purpose of the ongoing discussion, the patterned device outline 32 define male pattern between which female pattern 38 be also form. Accordingly, an array of alternate male/female pattern be form over the substrate wherein the sidewall spacers 36 be form in the female pattern 38. Referring to FIG. 7, and after form the sidewall spacers 36, the male pattern or pattern device outline 32 be remove by suitable etch technique. The etch etch the device outline 32 relative to the material form spacers 36 and the substrate 34. Such leaf behind a plurality of upstanding sidewall spacers 36 which effectively define thin electrically insulative partition between which a plurality of device be to be form. As show, the distance or lateral spacing between adjacent spacers varies from spacer-to-spacer. According to one aspect, a plurality of space 40 a through 40 i be provide wherein adjacent space, such as 40 a and 40 b, differ slightly in lateral width dimension, while alternate space, such as 40 a and 40 c, have substantially the same lateral width dimension. Referring to FIG. 8, a conductive material 42 be form over the substrate 34 and the sidewall spacers 36 and may completely fill the space 40 a through 40 i. An example material for the layer 42 be conductively doped polysilicon. Referring to FIG. 9, the conductive material 42 be etch back by suitable method such as a chemical-mechanical polish( CMP) or dry etching, as be know in the art. Such form a plurality of substantially identically shape circuit device relative to the pattern device outline 32( FIG. 6). In this embodiment, such device be conductive line 44 which be space laterally from one another a distance which be no great than a width of one of the electrically insulative sidewall spacers 36 therebetween. As so form, immediately adjacent conductive line of the plurality of line form have a pitch P2 which be substantially no great than a lateral line width L2 plus a width W2 of the spacer 36 which be position between the adjacent line. As compare to the pitch P1( FIG. 3) of the prior circuit device, pitch P2 represent a reduction in pitch which approach fifty percent. Such achieved pitch reduction be without regard to the prior art photolithographic spacing constraint impose on semiconductor processing. As mention above, the spacing between adjacent spacers 36 varies from one spacer 36 to another spacer 36. Accordingly, the pitch P2 vary as well. It be possible for the spacing between adjacent spacers 36 to be uniform, however, so that the pitch remain constant across the substrate 34. Referring to FIG. 10, a top plan view of the substrate 34 be show. Conductive line 44 collectively define a series of conductive line which in turn define a device array 46 of substantially identically shaped device. The array 46 include the plurality of upstanding spacers 36 and the conductive line 44 form intermediate the spacers 36. In accordance with one aspect of the invention and as describe with reference to FIG. 9 above, adjacent line 44 have a pitch which be substantially no great than about the distance between a pair of adjacent spacers 36( correspond to the line width) plus the width of the spacer 36 therebetween. In the illustrated example, conductive line 44 be elongate and adjacent conductive line 44 have different lateral line width. Additionally, alternate line 44 have substantially equal lateral line width. Such variation in line width stem from the manner in which the anisotropically etch sidewall spacers 36 be provide over the substrate 34, and in particular the lateral spacing of device outline 32( FIG. 5). As mention above, it be possible for the line width to be substantially equal over the entire substrate 34. Referring still to FIG. 10, a dashed line 48 traverse the device array 46. Individual elongate conductive line 44 be form over the substrate 34 transversely along the line 48. Respective alternate device along the line 48 have a substantially common width dimension therealong and respective adjacent device have a different width dimension therealong. Referring collectively to FIGS. 11-18, a semiconductor processing method of form a plurality of alternate device on a substrate in accordance with the above-described principle be describe. According to one aspect of the invention, the device comprise capacitor, and may comprise capacitor form part of a dynamic random access memory( DRAM) device. Circuit device other than the illustrated and described conductive line and capacitor can be fabricate in accordance with the invention. In accordance with one embodiment, a plurality of bit line contact be form in opening etch over a substrate in one etch step, and a plurality of capacitor container opening be etch over the substrate in another two separate etch step. Thereafter, correspond DRAM capacitor be form within the container opening accord to know processing technique. As so form, and in accordance with the above-described spacer formation and pitch reduction concept, a plurality of pair of adjacent capacitor be form in respective adjacent capacitor container which be separate by no more than anisotropically etch, electrically insulative sidewall spacers as will become evident below. Referring specifically to FIG. 11, a semiconductor wafer fragment in process be show generally at 50 and include a layer of material 52 which may or not may be semiconductive. Transistors form part of the DRAM circuitry array be not show, but may be form elevationally below the capacitor describe hereafter, and contact to these underlie structure may be form, for example, use polysilicon plug. Other elevational configuration as between transistor and capacitor be possible. A layer 54 be form over the material 52. In one embodiment, the layer 54 be form from borophosphosilicate glass( BPSG) to a thickness around two micron. A layer 56 be then form on the layer 54. In one embodiment, the layer 56 be form from silicon nitride to have a thickness of between 200 and 400 angstrom. In one embodiment, the layer 56 be form by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. In one embodiment, the layer 56 be form from tantalum pentoxide. A layer 58 be then form on the layer 56. In one embodiment, the layer 58 be form from BPSG or from TEOS-deposited silicon dioxide. In one embodiment, the layer 58 be form to have a thickness of between 300 and 600 Angstroms. In one embodiment, the layer 56 be form from a material provide chemical selectivity relative to the layer 54 and 58 and thus may function as an etch stop. Referring to FIG. 12, the layer 54, 56 and 58 be anisotropically etch to form bit line contact and capacitor contact open 60 through the layer 54, 56 and 58. Thereafter, contact material 62 be form over the substrate and into the opening 60. In one embodiment, the contact material 62 be conductively doped polysilicon. Such contact material 62 be or may be planarized by suitable chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etch to provide the illustrated contact or plug 62. The plugs 62 be in electrical communication with circuit node, such as transistor, that be previously form accord to know principle. The layer 58 be choose to have a thickness sufficient that if the surface of the plug 62 be erode by the planarization process, the plug 62 together with the layer 56 still form a continuous chemical barrier to prevent etching of the layer 54 during subsequent processing step. Referring to FIG. 13, a thick layer 64 be then form over the contact 62 and the layer 58. In one embodiment, the layer 64 be form from BPSG. In one embodiment, the layer 64 be form to have a thickness of 1.5 micron, however, other thickness be possible. A photoresist pattern correspond to bite line contact opening 66 be form on the layer 64. The bit line contact openings 66 be anisotropically etch through the layer 64 and 58 and may or may not continue through the layer 56. In one embodiment, the bit line contact opening 66 have a width of between 0.16 and 0.26 micron. Referring to FIG. 14, sidewall spacers 68 be form in the bit line contact openings 66. In one embodiment, the sidewall spacers 68 be form by deposit a layer of silicon nitride 200 Angstroms thick and then anisotropically etch the silicon nitride layer to remove portion of the layer form on the contact 62 and on other horizontal feature. In one embodiment, second sidewall spacers 70 be then form within the sidewall spacers 68. In one embodiment, the second sidewall spacers 70 be form by deposit up to 600 Angstroms of silicon dioxide. The silicon dioxide be then anisotropically etch to remove the silicon dioxide from the contact 62 and other horizontal feature. Bit line contact 72 be then form in opening 66. In one embodiment, the bit line contact 72 be form by deposit conductive polysilicon follow by planarization, such as chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etching. The sidewall spacers 68 and 70 collectively act to reduce capacitance from the bit line contact 72 to neighbor capacitor to be form in subsequent step. The second sidewall spacers 70 may be form from silicon dioxide and to have a great thickness than the first sidewall spacers 68 in order to reduce capacitance, due to the reduce relative dielectric constant of silicon dioxide relative to that of silicon nitride. The first sidewall spacers 68 and the bit line contact 72 seal the second sidewall spacers 70 and prevent the second sidewall spacers from be etch during subsequent processing step. Referring to FIG. 15, first capacitor container 76 be then form. A photoresist layer 88( FIG. 19) be form to define opening correspond to the first capacitor container 76 and an anisotropic etch be use to etch through the layer 64 and 58, stop at the contact 62 and the layer 56. The photoresist layer 88 be then strip and sidewall spacers 74 be form. In one embodiment, the sidewall spacers 74 be form by deposit a 300 Angstrom thick layer of silicon nitride and then anisotropically etch the silicon nitride to remove it from the contact 62 and other horizontal surface. A thin photoresist layer be then apply and be expose to remove the photoresist from the layer 64 and the bit line contact 72 but not from bottom of the first capacitor container 76. A wet etch process such as a hydrofluoric acid etch may then be use to remove exposed portion of the layer 64 and form second capacitor container 78, as show in FIG. 16. Individual container of a pair of capacitor container 76 and 78 be separate from each other by no more than the width of a non-conducting partition 74. As discuss above with reference to the pitch advantage achieve with conductive line 44( FIGS. 9 and 10), such advantage be achieve through the use of spacers or partition 74 which electrically isolate adjacent capacitor form in respective capacitor container 76 and 78. Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, electrically conductive container material 80 be form over the substrate and planarized( FIG. 18) to define a plurality of capacitor storage node in select container shape. In one embodiment, the electrically conductive container material 80 be conductive polysilicon. In one embodiment, the electrically conductive container material 80 be hemispherical grain polysilicon. In one embodiment, the hemispherical grain polysilicon provide an HSG factor of about 1.8, that be, provide an increase in surface area of 1.8 relative to that of a comparable flat polysilicon layer. Subsequently, capacitor be form accord to conventional formation technique by provision of a dielectric layer 82 over respective storage node 76, 78 and provision of a subsequent polysilicon layer 84 thereover. As so form, capacitor in respective partitioned part of the area define by capacitor container 76 and 78 be separate from immediately adjacent capacitor or have a close separation distance which be substantially no great than the width of the partition or spacer 74 between the capacitor. Referring to FIG. 19, a diagrammatic semiconductor mask layout and DRAM array be designate generally by reference numeral 88. Layout 88 be utilize to enable the above-described container to be selectively, alternately form or etch in the two describe separate etching step. For purpose of clarity, FIG. 15 be take along line 1515 in FIG. 19 at a processing point just after the etching of opening 76( FIG. 15) use layout 88. Layout 88 enables capacitor have unique, space-saving geometry to be form over the substrate. According to one aspect of the invention, the electrically insulative partition 74( FIG. 15) be form between adjacent capacitor intermediate the two etch step which form or define the area over the substrate in which the capacitor will be form. The partition 74 be not show for clarity in FIG. 19. Mask layout 88 include a plurality of row such as those illustrate at R1, R2, R3 and R4. The mask layout also include a plurality of column such as those illustrate at C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7. A plurality of masked area 90 and a plurality of adjacent unmasked area 92 be define by the layout. Unmasked area 92 correspond to capacitor container open pattern 76 in FIG. 15 and mask area 90 correspond to photoresist. Layout 88 enables a plurality of capacitor to be form, which may be as part of a DRAM array over the substrate, wherein respective alternate capacitor in a row, such as row R1-R4, have substantially similar lateral width profile transverse the row. In one embodiment, respective adjacent capacitor in a row have different lateral width profile transverse the row. The illustrated lateral width profile when view from a point above the substrate approximate triangle which be orient in a top-to-bottom fashion across the row. Additionally, individual define area in which the capacitor pair be to be form( correspond to the view take along line 1515 in column C5) approximate a diamond shape with such shape have at its respective corner, bit line contact 94 which be form as describe above. For purpose of the ongoing discussion, each of columns C1-C7 be form along a generally straight line which be generally transverse each of row R1-R4. Further, the array of capacitor pair to be form be form along individual line which contain at least one of the pair of capacitor. As such, the array be define by a plurality of the line( correspond to the plurality of the column) which contain a plurality of capacitor which be separate by substantially no more than an electrically insulative anisotropically etch spacer 74 as describe above. Underlying word line be show by dashed line 93 and interconnect associate transistor form relative to the substrate. Individual bit line be not specifically show but be subsequently form and orient generally transversely relative to the word line 93. It have be discover that two different effect can distort relative size of the first, dry etch capacitor container 76 relative to the second, wet etch capacitor container 78. A first of these effect be that the wet clean follow the dry etch use to form the dry etch container may also enlarge the first capacitor container 76, in part by tend to make the first capacitor container 76 more rounded. This tend to cause the first capacitor container 76 to be enlarge relative to the second capacitor container 78. The first effect tend to be exacerbate by need to wet etch to remove any remain BPSG from side of the bit line contact 72. A second of these effect be that, especially for very small first and second capacitor container 76 and 78, exposure of positive photoresist tend to result in curvature or rounding of edge of the photoresist pattern 90, which also tend to enlarge the first capacitor container 76 relative to the second capacitor container 78. It have be far discover that these effect may be ameliorate by use a negative resist to form the photoresist pattern 90. Use of a negative resist tend to reverse the direction of curvature of the edge of the photoresist pattern 90. In turn, this allow a longer wet etch in order to ensure complete removal of any BPSG remain on side of the bit line contact 72. As a result, pattern distortion originate in the photolithography process use to define the photoresist pattern 90 tend to cancel out pattern distortion of the first capacitor container 76 originate in the wet etch process use to define the second capacitor container 78. In turn, the first and second capacitor container 76 and 78 tend to be more nearly equal, result in improved DRAM operation and in improved operating margin for such DRAMs. Referring to FIG. 20, a mask layout 88 defines in part a DRAM array which include a plurality of six-capacitor geometry which be to be form over the substrate. A representative of one of the geometry be indicate generally by reference numeral 96 and a plurality of adjacent or other geometry be show in phantom line. The illustrated six-capacitor geometry be, in turn, define by a plurality of individual polygonal capacitor geometry show collectively at 98 through 108. In one embodiment, collective individual capacitor geometry 98 through 108 approximate a hexagon, individual side of which be define by a side of a different respective one of the individual polygonal capacitor geometry. For example, the six-capacitor geometry or hexagon 96 include six side collectively show at 96 a, 96 b, 96 c, 96 d, 96 e and 96 f. Each of such side be define by a different respective one of the individual side of the individual polygonal capacitor geometry 98 through 108. According to one embodiment of the invention, the individual polygonal capacitor geometry 98 through 108, when view outwardly of the substrate, approximate a wedge or wedge-shape. In one embodiment, such individual geometry approximate a triangle which may be an isosceles triangle. In one embodiment, individual approximate isosceles triangle include equal adjacent angle which approximate a range of between about 50 to 70. Such equal adjacent angle be show for the individual geometry 100, 104 and 108. In one embodiment, such equal adjacent angle approximate an angle of about 65. The individual geometry 98 through 102 and 104 through 108, respectively, may be arrange in a top-to-bottom orientation such that the hexagon 96 can be bisect, as show by dashed line 110, into half contain exactly three individual polygonal capacitor geometry. In the illustrated hexagon, one of the half, a top half as view in FIG. 20, contain the individual geometry 98, 100 and 102. The other of the half, a bottom half, contain the geometry 104, 106 and 108. Referring to FIG. 21, the top half contain the geometry 98, 100 and 102 be show, comprise a three-capacitor geometry 112. A plurality of three-capacitor geometry 112 be dispose over the substrate. In one embodiment, the three-capacitor geometry 112, when view outwardly of the substrate, define a pair of overlap approximated parallelogram, the intersection of which approximate a triangle. A first of such parallelogram be show at 114. A second of such parallelogram be show at 116. The parallelogram 114 include side 114 a, 114 b, 114 c and 114 d. The parallelogram 116 include side 116 a, 116 b, 116 c and 116 d. The parallelogram share side 114 b and 116 d. As show, each approximate parallelogram be bound at a respective one of its corner by a bit line contact 94. The approximated triangle define by the intersection of the parallelogram 114, 116 include side 114 c, 116 c and share side 114 b/116 d. For purpose of ongoing discussion, a plurality of capacitor pair be selectively and alternately etch over the substrate along etch ax which be generally orthogonal relative to the substrate and into the plane of the page upon which FIG. 21 appear. Such capacitor pair can approximate the above described parallelogram and would include the individual capacitor etch as a result of individual geometry 98, 100, or alternatively 100, 102. Referring to both FIGS. 16 and 19, a DRAM array be form atop a substrate and include a first set of capacitor form in first set of capacitor container 76 over the substrate. A second set of capacitor be form over the substrate and in second set capacitor container 78.

In one embodiment, individual first set capacitor have a close separation distance from at least one of the three bounding capacitor which be substantially no more than a width of an electrically insulative anisotropically etch spacer 74( FIG. 16). In one embodiment, individual bound first set capacitor have close separation distance from no less than two and possibly three of the bounding capacitor which be no more than the width of an electrically insulative anisotropically etched spacer form or provide between the respective capacitor. The above described semiconductor device form method and integrated circuitry form thereby constitute an improvement which relate to device space over a substrate. Such improvement enables device pitch to be reduce by almost fifty percent or more which represent a substantial space saving over heretofore available method and device.

In contrast to silicon technology that have a very mature and useful complementary metal oxide semiconductor( CMOS) technology. Field effect transistor( FETs) widely use in the III-V semiconductor industry employ metal gate and Schottky gate contact that be have quiescent-state leakage current exceed many microamps. The use of metal gate in compound semiconductor technology further result in individual transistor and integrated circuit that have excessively high power dissipation, reduce transconductance, reduce logic swing and the inability to operate on a single power supply, and generally limited performance characteristic. The high magnitude of the quiescent leakage current limit the maximum integration of GaAs device to circuit of several hundred thousand transistor for those skilled in the art. In contrast, the simultaneous integration of many million of transistor be possible at high integration density use silicon CMOS technology. These ultra high integration density and level can not be obtain use metal, Schottky-style gate that be not insulate in compound semiconductor FETs. Thus Si CMOS technology offer significant advantage in term of individual gate leakage, circuit integration level and cost. However when compare to silicon, complementary GaAs and InP circuit technology exhibit faster and more optimized speed/power performance and efficiency at a low supply voltage of 1V and below. The market acceptance of these GaAs and InP integrate circuit technology remain low because of the lack of ability to demonstrate high integration density with low amount of operating power. Thus, silicon CMOS dominate the field of digital integrated circuitry and neither GaAs nor InP technology can successfully penetrate this market.

The present application claim priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-381216 file on Dec. 27, 2002, which be hereby incorporate by reference. 2. Description of the Related Art In recent year, to satisfy a need for scale-down and high integration of a semiconductor device, when silicon oxide( SiO2) be use as a gate insulating film, it be necessary to reduce its film thickness of, for example, an FET( Field Effect Transistor) to several nanometer or less. However, a problem arise that, if the gate insulating film be make so extremely thin, a tunnel current flowing when a gate bias be apply becomes so large, compare with a source-drain current, that it can not be neglect. To solve this problem, a method be propose in which, by use an insulator material have a relative dielectric constant be high than that of silicon oxide, a gate insulating film practically and effectively make thin. For example, a method for manufacture an FET be disclose in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-314072 in which zirconium oxide have a relative dielectric constant r be about 30 be use as a material for a gate insulating film instead of silicon oxide( see FIG. 15). The disclosed FET 101, as show in FIG. 15, have a silicon substrate 103 on which a source-drain region 102 be form, a gate insulating film 104 be deposit on the silicon substrate 103, and a gate electrode 105 made of polycrystalline silicon( poly-Si) form on the gate insulating film 104. In the technology, an aluminum oxide layer 106 be deposit on the silicon substrate 103, serve as a seed layer, and a zirconium oxide layer 107 be deposit on the aluminum oxide layer 106. As show in FIG. 15, in manufacture the FET 101, the gate insulating film 104 as multilayer be form on the silicon substrate 103, by deposit in sequence and stack the aluminum oxide layer 106 and zirconium oxide layer 107 both be amorphous on the silicon substrate 103. Also, another method for manufacture an FET 201 be propose, as show in FIG. 16, in which hafnium oxide have a relative dielectric constant r be about 20 be use as the material for the gate insulating film. The FET 201, as show in FIG. 16, have a silicon substrate 203 on which a source-drain region 202 be form, a gate insulating film 204 made of hafnium oxide be deposit on the silicon substrate 203, and a gate electrode 205 form directly on the gate insulating film 204. To manufacture the FET 201, a hafnium oxide layer be deposit on the silicon substrate 203 to form the gate insulating film 204. Here, a film thickness consider the relative dielectric constant of metal oxide be simply call an EOT( Equivalent Oxide Thickness). As show by a characteristic curve Lp in FIG. 17, a relation between the EOT and a leakage current density obtain when a metal be use as a material for the gate electrode 205 in the FET 201 in FIG. 16 be excellent. In FIG. 17, a characteristic curve Lq show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtain when polycrystalline silicon be use as the material for the gate electrode 205. Also, in FIG. 17, a characteristic curve Lr show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtain when polycrystalline silicon be use as the material for the gate electrode 205 and the gate insulating film 204 be make up of only aluminum oxide and a characteristic curve Ls show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtain when polycrystalline silicon be use as the material for the gate electrode 205 and the gate insulating film 204 be make up of only silicon oxide. Moreover, when metal as describe above be use as the material for the gate electrode 205, though an experiment on only such the characteristic as the relation between the EOT and leakage current density show good result, the metal can not be practically employ due to follow reason. That be, in an LSI( Large Scale Integrated Circuit), two kind of FETs( Field Effect Transistors), one be an nMOSFET( n-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor FET) and another be a pMOSFET( p-type MOSFET). Therefore, it be necessary to form gate electrode each have a different work function on a same wafer at the same time. When polycrystalline silicon or germanium polycrystalline silicon be use as a material for the gate electrode, by perform a doping process, the work function of the gate electrode can be change. However, if metal be use as the material for the gate electrode, since a work function can not be change, there be a difficulty in manufacture a CMOS( Complementary MOS). Also, generally, if metal be use as a material for the gate electrode, the gate insulating film be easily short-circuited due to a reaction between the gate electrode and gate insulating film cause by heat treatment for source/drain activation. To solve this problem, by use polycrystalline silicon or a like as the material for the gate electrode and, at the same time, by use a material have a high relative dielectric constant as the material for the gate insulating film, an effort to obtain the excellent characteristic( the relation between the EOT and leakage current density) be make. However, this method have also a problem in that, if zirconium oxide be use as the material for the gate insulating film, crystallization of amorphous zirconium oxide occur due to heat treatment in a process of form the gate electrode 105 or of form the source/drain region 102, or if polycrystalline silicon be use as the material for the gate electrode 105, a short-circuit be make due to incompatibility with zirconium oxide. Moreover, an another problem arise that, if hafnium oxide be use as the material for the gate insulating film, crystallization of the hafnium oxide easily occur due to heat treatment which cause occurrence of a grain boundary passing through high and low electrode. These problem cause an increase in a leakage current lead to easy occurrence of dielectric breakdown and to reduction in reliability of semiconductor device. Furthermore, if polycrystalline silicon be use as a material for the gate electrode, an electrostatic capacity become low compare with the case where metal be use as the material for the gate electrode and, as show by the characteristic curve Lq in FIG. 17, the EOT be greatly degrade compare with the case show by the characteristic curve Lp.

Moreover, during a period after completion of the introduction of each material gas before introduction of subsequent same material gas or different material gas, nitrogen( N2) be introduce as a purge gas through the gas introduce pipe 14 d in a pulse-like manner. In FIGS. 6 and 7, pulse-like waveform pa, pb, pc, and pd represent, respectively, flow rate of TMA, ozone, hafnium tetrachloride and nitrogen, which change with a passage of time t. In the embodiment, as show in FIG. 6, specify flow rate Qa of TMA be first introduce into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 a during a gas introducing time ta( t1tt2).

Thus, since three layer( 3 mono-layers) of hafnium oxide be deposit on one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide, the hafnium aluminate layer have a specified composition ratio be form when view macroscopically. In the embodiment as show in FIG. 6, time t( =t33t1) require for the formation of the one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide and three layer of hafnium oxide be set to be several second. Then, the above formation process of the one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide and three layer of hafnium oxide be repeatedly perform. By these operation, the low layer gate insulating film 8 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate have a specified composition ratio be form when view macroscopically. Next, as show in FIG. 3C, an upper layer gate insulating film( second insulating film) 18 make of amorphous hafnium aliminate contain a specified concentration of hafnium and aluminum be form on the low layer gate insulating film 8 by the ALD method. That be, as show in FIG. 7, specify flow rate Qc of hafnium tetrachloride be introduce into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 c during the gas introducing time tc( t51tt52).

By these operation, one layer( 1 mono-layer) of hafnium oxide be form. Next, specify flow rate Qa of TMA be introduce into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 a during the gas introducing time ta( t59tt60). Then, specify flow rate Qd of nitrogen be introduce as the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td( t61tt62). Then, specify flow rate Qb of ozone be introduce as the oxidize agent into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 b during the gas introducing time tb( t63tt64). Furthermore, specify flow rate Qd of nitrogen be introduce as the purge gas into the vacuum container 12 through the gas introduce pipe 14 d during the gas introducing time td( t65tt66). By these operation, one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide be form. Next, operation of the introduction of TMA, nitrogen, ozone, and nitrogen describe above be repeat twice in addition. That be, by introduce TMA during the gas introducing time ta( t67tt68), nitrogen during the gas introducing time td( t69tt70), ozone during the gas introducing time tb( t71tt72), and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time td( t73tt74), additional one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide be form. Then, by introduce TMA during the gas introducing time ta( t75tt76), nitrogen during the gas introducing time td( t77tt78), ozone during the gas introducing time tb( t79tt80), and again nitrogen during the gas introducing time td( t81tt82), further additional one layer( 1 mono-layer) of aluminum oxide be form. Thus, since three layer of aluminum oxide be deposit on one layer( 1 mono-layer) of hafnium oxide, the hafnium aluminate layer have a specified composition ratio be form when view macroscopically. In the embodiment as show in FIG. 7, time t( =t83t51) require for the formation of the one layer( 1 mono-layer) of afnium oxide and three layer( 3 mono-layers) of aluminum oxide be set to be several second. Then the above formation process of the one layer( 1 mono-layer) of hafnium oxide and three layer of aluminum oxide be repeatedly perform. By these operation the upper layer gate insulating film 18 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate have a specified composition ratio be form when view macroscopically. Moreover in the embodiment a film thickness of the upper layer insulating film 18 be about one third or more of that of the low layer gate insulating film 8. Next a gate electrode make of for example polycrystalline silicon be deposit on the upper layer gate insulating film 18. That be as show in FIG. 3D an electrode layer 19 made of polycrystalline silicon( p-Si) have a film thickness of for example 50( 5 nm) be deposit on the upper layer gate insulating film 18 by use a CVD( Chemical vapor Deposition) method. Next as show in FIG. 4A a gate electrode 6 be form by perform pattern operation use photolithography and etch technology. As show in FIG. 8 a hafnium concentration Nh be set to be for example 75% in the low layer gate insulating film 8 that be in a region with a distance d from an interface of the low layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate be within a range of( 0dda) and to be for example 25% in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 that be in a region with a distance d from an interface of the low layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate be within a range of( daddg) and be set so as to be discontinuously change at a boundary region( d=da). Here da represent a thickness of the low layer gate insulating film 8 and dg represent a total thickness of the low layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18. In this case an aluminum concentration Na be set to be 25% in the low layer gate insulating film 8 and to be 75% in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 and a relation of[ Na[%] =100Nh] be maintain. Then after specify impurity have be implant into the silicon substrate 3 by use the gate electrode 6 as a mask an annealing process be perform at a temperature of for example 1000 C. to form the source-drain region 2 as show in FIG. 4B. Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the low layer gate insulating film 8 and upper layer gate insulating film 18 the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion as a result cause the boundary to disappear and the single layer gate insulating film 5 to be form. Thus the FET 1 as show in FIG. 1 be obtain. Next a characteristic in the region in the obtained FET 1 where the gate insulating film 5 be form be describe by refer to FIG. 1 and FIG. 9. Especially in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 show in FIG. 1 since the region be position immediately below the gate electrode 6 the concentration of aluminum be set to be comparatively high. This enable prevention of degradation of the EOT of the gate insulating film 5 cause by use of polycrystalline silicon( polycrystalline semiconductor) as the material for the gate electrode 6 and by use of only hafnium oxide as the material for the gate insulating film 5 and thus enable suppression of lower in electrostatic capacitance which serve to reduce leakage current. Moreover since the gate insulating film 5 contain a specified concentration of hafnium lowering of a dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 be suppress which serve to ensure a required EOT. Also since in the region 5 a on the low layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the hafnium concentration Nh be set to be relatively high lowering in the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 be suppress thus serve to ensure the required EOT and at the same time since a specified concentration of aluminum be contain crystallization of hafnium oxide can be prevent. Therefore occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppress thus serve to prevent an increase in leakage current. Moreover an investigation of a relation between the EOT and leakage current density make to evaluate a characteristic of the FET 1 show good result as show in FIG. 9. In FIG. 9 a characteristic curve L1 show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density in the FET 1 of the embodiment. Also a characteristic curve La show a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtain when metal be use as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 be make up of only hafnium oxide. Furthermore characteristic curve Lb Lc and Ld show relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtain when polycrystalline silicon be use as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 be make up of only hafnium oxide only aluminum oxide and only silicon oxide respectively. As show in FIG. 9 in the case of the FET 1 of the embodiment the EOT be greatly reduce when compare with the case where the gate insulating film 5 be make up of only hafnium oxide and its characteristic come near to that obtain when metal be use as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 be make up of only hafnium oxide. Thus accord to the configuration of the FET of the embodiment since in the region 5 a on the low layer side of the gate insulating film 5 whose thickness occupy about three fourth of all thickness of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of hafnium be a material have a high dielectric constant be make comparatively high and since also in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 hafnium be contain in a specified concentration it be possible to suppress lowering of the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 and to ensure the required EOT. Moreover since in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of aluminum be make comparatively high and since in the region immediately below the gate electrode 6 the aluminum concentration Na be make particularly high when polycrystalline silicon( polycrystalline semiconductor) be use as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 be make up of only hafnium oxide it be possible to suppress lowering of an electrostatic capacitance that be to prevent degradation of the EOT and to reduce leakage current. Also not only in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 but also in the region 5 a on the low layer side of the gate insulating film 5 in which the concentration of hafnium be set to be relatively high aluminum be contain in a specify concentration which enable crystallization of hafnium oxide to be suppress. As a result occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppress and an increase in leakage current can be prevent. This enable dielectric breakdown to be reduce thus improve reliability of the semiconductor device. Also since crystallization of hafnium oxide can be suppress surface roughness can be improve and a local concentration of electric field in a region in which film thickness be small can be avoid which enable leakage current to be reduce thus improve reliability of the semiconductor device. Moreover by provide heat treatment after the upper layer gate insulating film 18 have be deposit on the low layer gate insulating film 8 the aluminum concentration Na and hafnium concentration Nh can be make changeable continuously in the boundary region it be possible to prevent such a problem as a decrease in a threshold value of the gate insulating film 5 cause by trap electric charge in the boundary region. Also since the ALD method be use to form the gate insulating film 5 improvement of film quality of the gate insulating film 5 be make possible by precisely control concentration of aluminum and hafnium and contamination cause by carbon contain in the material gas can be prevent by introduce the purge gas.

The FET 21 of the second embodiment differs greatly from the FET 1 employ in the first embodiment in that in the first embodiment after the low layer insulating film 8 and upper layer insulating film 18 have be form concentration be continuously change at the boundary region 5 c in a process of heat treatment however in the second embodiment after a plurality of intermediate insulating film whose hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na be change in stage have be form between a low gate insulating film and an upper gate insulating film and a heat treatment process be perform. Configurations other than describe above be almost the same as those in the first embodiment and their description be make simple accordingly. The FET( semiconductor device) 21 of the second embodiment as show in FIG. 10 include a silicon substrate 23 have a source-drain region 22 into which specify impurity have be implant be form a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide be deposit on the silicon substrate 23 a gate insulating film 25 form on the seed layer 24 a gate electrode 26 made of for example polycrystalline silicon be deposit on the gate insulating film 25. The gate insulating film 25 have a specify thickness( for example 20 to 50 that be about 2 nm to 5 nm) and be so formed that each of composition ratio change along a direction of its thickness toward the gate electrode 6 from a side of the silicon substrate 23 thus cause a hafnium concentration Nh to monotonously become low and an aluminum concentration Na to monotonously become high. Moreover as show in FIG. 10 the gate insulating film 25 have a region 25 a( first insulate region) on a low layer side immediately above the silicon substrate 23 a region 25 b( second insulate region) on an upper layer side immediately below the gate electrode 26 and an intermediate region 25 c( third insulate region) be sandwich between the region 25 a on the low layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side and both the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na be almost constant in each of the region 25 a on the low layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side. As show in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 the intermediate region 25 c( d3dd10) have a first intermediate region 25 p( d4dd5) a second intermediate region 25 q( d6dd7) a third intermediate region 25 r( d8dd9) a boundary region 25 s( d3dd4) between the region 25 a on the low layer side and the first intermediate region 25 p a boundary region 25 t( d5dd6) between the first intermediate region 25 p and the secondary intermediate region 25 q a boundary region 25 u( d7dd8) between the second intermediate region 25 q and the third intermediate region 25 r and a boundary region 25 v( d9dd10) between the third intermediate region 25 r and region 25 b on the upper layer side. Here in the first intermediate region 25 p second intermediate region 25 q and third intermediate region 25 r each of the hafnium and the aluminum have a specify concentration be almost constant and in the boundary region 25 s the boundary region 25 t the boundary region 25 u and the boundary region 25 v each of the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na continuously change. As show in FIG. 12 the hafnium concentration Nh be set to be for example 75% in the region 25 a on the low layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be for example 25% in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and change continuously and in stage in the intermediate region 25 c. In this case the aluminum concentration Na be set to be 25% in the region 25 a on the low layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be 75% in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and a relation of( Na=100Nh) be maintain. Next a method for manufacture the FET 21 of the second embodiment be describe by refer to FIG. 13. First as show in FIG. 13A a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide be form on a silicon substrate 23 by the thermal oxidation method. Then a low layer gate insulating film 27 made of hafnium aluminate contain a specified concentration of hafnium and aluminum be form on the seed layer 24 by the ALD method. Then the first intermediate insulating film( third insulating film) 28 second intermediate insulating film( third insulating film) 29 third intermediate insulating film( third insulating film) 31 be form on the low layer gate insulating film 27 in a manner that the hafnium concentration Nh become low in order( the aluminum concentration Na become high in order). Next the upper layer gate insulating film 32 whose hafnium concentration Nh be make low than that of the third intermediate insulating film 31 be form on the third intermediate insulating film 31. Then an electrode layer 33 made of polycrystalline silicon be form on the upper layer gate insulating film 32 for example by the CVD method. Then as show in FIG. 13B a gate electrode 26 be form by perform pattern operation use photolithography and etch technology. As show in FIG. 14 the hafnium concentration Nh be set to be for example 75% in the low layer gate insulating film 27 that be in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate be within a range of( 0ddb) and to be for example 25% in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 that be in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate be within a range of( dfddg) and be set to be a specify constant value so as to become low in order within a range of( 25% Nh75%) in each of the first intermediate insulating film 28 that be in a region within a range of( dbddc) the second intermediate insulating film 29 that be in a region within a range of( dcdde) and the third intermediate insulating film 31( deddf) and be set so as to discontinuously change in each of the boundary region( d=db dc de and df). In this case the aluminum concentration Na be set to be 25% in the low layer gate insulating film 27 and to be 75% in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 and a relation of Na[%] =100Nh be maintain. Then after specify impurity have be implant into the silicon substrate 23 by use the gate electrode 26 as a mask an annealing process be perform to form a source-drain region 22 as show in FIG. 13C. Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the low layer gate insulating film 27 and the first intermediate insulating film 28 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the first intermediate insulating film 28 and the second intermediate insulating film 29 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the second intermediate insulating film 29 and the third intermediate insulating film 31 and in a region in the vicinity of the third intermediate insulating film 31 and the upper layer gate insulating film 32 the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion cause the boundary to disappear and as a result the single layer gate insulating film 25 to be form. Thus the FET 21 as show in FIG. 10 be obtain. According to the second embodiment almost the same effect as achieve in the first embodiment describe above can be obtain. Additionally since the change in concentration in the boundary region be make more mild the characteristic can be more improved. It be apparent that the present invention be not limit to the above embodiment but may be change and modify without depart from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example in the above embodiments the gate insulate film 5 and 25 be form by the ALD method however instead of the ALD method the CVD method can be use for form the gate insulate film 5 or 25. This enable a throughput( process capability) to be improve. The CVD method that can be use here include for example an atmospheric CVD method a reduced pressure CVD method a plasma enhance CVD method or a like. Moreover the gate electrode can be form as a multi-layer structure in which metal layer be stack on a polycrystalline layer. Polycrystalline silicon-germanium[ SiGe] instead of polycrystalline silicon can be use as a material for the gate electrode. The material gas that can be use when the gate insulate film 5 or 25 be form by the ALD method include Hf( NMe2) 4[ tetrakis( dimethylamino) hafnium] Hf( NEt2) 4[ tetrakis( diethylamino) hafnium] Hf( NMeEt) 4[ tetrakis( methylethylamino) hafnium] Hf( t-Bu) 4[ tetra t-butyl hafnium] instead of HfCl4[ hafnium tetrachloride]. Also as the oxidize agent instead of ozone( O3) oxygen( O2) or water( H2O) may be use. The formation of the seed layer 4 or 24 may be omit. In the above embodiment by the thermal treatment in the process of form the source-drain region the concentration of hafnium or aluminum be change continuously in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the low layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18. However to make continuous the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum a thermal treatment in a process of form a gate electrode may be use or a thermal treatment process to make mild the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum may be provide separately. The temperature for the thermal treatment be set to be within a range between 800 C. or more and 1000 C. or less. Also in the above first embodiment the boundary region 5 c be form where the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na be continuously change along a thickness direction of the gate insulating film 5 by the thermal treatment however the FET of the present invention may be so construct as to have an interface instead of the boundary region 5 c. Moreover in the first embodiment each of the hafnium concentration Nh and the aluminum concentration Na be constant in the region 5 a on the low layer side of the gate insulating film 5 and the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 however the present invention be not limit to this that be the FET may be construct so that the hafnium concentration Nh become low and the aluminum concentration Na become high in these region 5 a and 5 b along a direction from a side of the substrate to a side of the gate electrode. In the first embodiment the thickness of the region 5 a on the low layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about three fourth and the thickness of the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about one fourth however the present invention be not limit to this that be a ratio of the thickness of the upper layer region 5 b may be make high. Furthermore in the second embodiment the three layer of the intermediate insulating film each have a different hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na be form however the present invention be not limit to this that be two layer or four layer or more of the intermediate insulating film may be form.

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relate to a sensor with at least one silicon-based micromechanical structure, and to a method for produce such a sensor. Sensors that have silicon-based micromechanical structure be know. If the micromechanical structure be movable element( sensor element), then such sensor can be use as acceleration sensor, rotary acceleration sensor, inclination sensor, resonant magnetic field sensor, or rotation rate sensor. Typically, these sensor comprise a foundation wafer, which be usually likewise form from material that contain silicon, in which the structure be integrate into a so-called sensor chamber of its surface. To protect the structure and the atmosphere prevail in the sensor chamber, the foundation wafer be cover with a cap wafer, with a cover that cover at least the sensor chamber. This cap wafer, because of its micromechanical prestructuring, have many individual cap join together, of which each individual cap come to rest exactly above the sensor chamber and be solder to the sensor chamber in hermetically seal fashion, and thus hermetically seal off the underlie sensor structure from the environment. From German Patent Disclosure DE 195 37 814 A1, the production of such sensor be know. Based on a silicon substrate, insulation layer and conductive layer( in the form of electrode or electrical connection) be apply in alternation, use the conventional method step know from semiconductor technology. By mean of mask and machine method, also know, structure of such layer can be do, for instance by way of lithography or etch process. In an ensue process step, a polycrystalline silicon layer( epipolysilicon), with a layer thickness range from a few nanometer to several ten of micrometer, preferably from 10 to 20 m, be create. From this silicon layer, in the final analysis the required structure be etch out and make freely movable by underetching. The previously apply, structure, bury conduction layer make it possible to establish electrical connection between element of the sensor and the outside world, in the form of so-called connection region. These connection region, which be connect via the conductive layer to sensor element, carry a metallizing on their surface. The connection region with the metallizing apply over it serve to secure bonding wire, with which an electrical contact with the structure in the sensor chamber( sensor structure) be then to be establish. The sensor structure describe in DE 195 37 814 A1 be distinguish by the fact that it have a movable( free-standing) region with measurement capacitor, where change in the measuring capacitance upon a deflection be use as a measurement variable. The component of the sensor, all describe as example here, will simply be call the foundation wafer, for the sake of simplify the further description. The foundation wafer must be hermetically tightly join to the cap wafer in a final machining step. To that end, in the prior art it be provide that a cap be secure above each sensor chamber to the surface of the foundation wafer by mean of a glass solder layer on the cap wafer( know as the seal-glass solder process). A disadvantage of this be that this technology be relatively expensive. The glass solder layer must be apply to the micromechanically structured cap wafer by mean of screen printing. The cap wafer must already be structure on both side to enable the ensue covering and contacting of the sensor; that be, the cap wafer itself be already intrinsically expensive. Moreover, this capping technique require a relatively large amount of space, in which up to about 75% of the individual element area be require for anchor the cap to the sensor chip. The resultant structural height and limit structure option preclude the use of certain especially economical housing for the sensor. Often, the free-standing region cover by the cap of the cap wafer be relatively large. Sensor structure often have edge length of several hundred micrometer. If such a sensor be subject to a mechanical overload, then in an extreme case, sagging of the cover layer can lead not only to interference with the sensor property but in the final analysis also to an excessive deflection of the sensor structure, to the point of irreversible damage. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, the disadvantage of the prior art be overcome by the sensor and the method for produce the sensor have the characteristic of the invention. Because in that the covering comprise a first layer( deposition layer) that be permeable to an etch medium and the reaction product, and a hermetically sealing second layer( seal layer) locate above it, it be possible in term of process technology to dispense with the expensive cap wafer, the conventional screen printing and soldering method, and the large reserve area for glass solder technology, and thus the processing can be complete substantially less expensive overall. Because( a) at least the sensor chamber present in the foundation wafer after the establishment of the structure be fill with an oxide, in particular CVD oxide or porous oxide;( b) the sensor chamber be cover by a first layer( deposition layer), in particular of polysilicon, that be transparent to an etch medium and the reaction product or be retroactively make transparent;( c) the oxide in the sensor chamber be remove through the deposition layer with the etch medium; and( d) next, a second layer( seal layer), in particular of metal or an insulator, be apply to the deposition layer and hermetically seal off the sensor chamber, it be possible to enable structuring of the cover retroactively, via the making and machining method know from semi-conductor technology. By step( a) and/or( b), planarizing of the wafer surface can be perform( for example by CMP, for Chemo-Mechanical Polishing). Existing process problem result especially from topography, such as apply and structure the bond pad( metallize), be thus circumvent. Compared to the establish cap process, the simplified course of the process also produce markedly reduce production cost. The invention thus provide access to a sensor of the generic type and disclose a method for produce the sensor, by which it be possible for the first time to employ cap with a markedly low structural height for hermetically seal off sensor chamber in micromechanical structure, so that it be now possible to install them in the aforementioned, especially economical housing. The permeability of the deposition layer for the requisite etching medium and the reaction product produce during the etching can be force in two different way. First, by anisotropic etching, etch opening can be make in the deposition layer, for instance by the silicon deep etching process patent in German Patent DE 42 41 045. The size and location of such etching opening can be define in a very targeted way photolithographically by mask, so that it be possible among other thing to keep any late exposure of the sensor chamber to the hermetically seal material form the seal layer as slight as possible. It be possible to create etching opening that have a diameter of fraction of micrometer up to several micrometer and that can be seal off in a relatively short time, in a manner to be describe below. This be attain for instance by mean of a high aspect ratiothat be, a ratio between the depth and diameter of the etching opening. Second, for the covering, permeable material such as silicon, polysilicon or epipolysilicon, which be already permeable because of the deposition condition or be make permeable by subsequent processing, can be use, at least in some region. An advantageous method for force the transparency of the covering be to employ electrochemical etch operation. One such modification of the deposition layer be do in a suitable electrolyte, such as a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol. The silicon of the cover expose to the etching operation be convert in this process into porous silicon, or in other word it be make porous. Regions of the deposition layer that be not to be make porous can be protect in a known manner by mean of mask layer or suitable doping( such as n). An electrical connection by apply an anodic potential could be do both via the top side and the underside of the deposition layer. In the latter case, the anodic potential be apply to the layer of epipolysilicon locate below the deposition layer and form both the material comprise the sensor structure and the bond frame of the foundation wafer. It be advantageous in this respect that the bond frame can be join directly electrically to the foundation wafer. An additional electrical connection between the foundation wafer and the cover exists in the form of support element, which can be provide for the sake of mechanically stabilize the covering. It be thus possible in a simple way to perform the electrical contacting of the deposition layer via the foundation wafer from the back side of the foundation wafer( back-side contact). The etch operation can be additionally reinforce by irradiation in a wavelength range from 100 nm to 1000 nm, in particular between 350 nm and 800 nm. In this way, the machining of the deposition layer can be do especially homogeneously. It be furthermore advantageous, by mean of targeted doping of the deposition layer, to vary the porosity and thus the permeability of the porous silicon. For instance, p-doping be use to create mesoporous pore, while an n-doping can be use to create etching opening with a diameter range from a few nanometer up to several micrometer. It have also prove advantageous to force the permeability of the deposition layer by mean of an also retroactively employ modify stain-etch operation, in which a mixture of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and water be employ. The porosity and depth of the etching can be adjust via an adjustment of the mixture proportion and exposure time. It have also prove especially advantageous to create the permeability of the deposition layer by mean of a galvanic process, in which a metal layer be apply to the region of the covering that be not to be change. Simultaneously, the metal layer take on the function of a masking layer and need not necessarily be remove before the late seal layer be apply. It comprise a metal that be noble than silicon, in particular such noble metal as platinum and gold. The porosity of the porous( poly) silicon create during the galvanic process can be vary as a function of a current density and the electrolyte composition, and in particular via the area ratio of metal to silicon, since the latter represent the galvanic element, that be, the current source. It have also prove advantageous that support element be provide on the underside of the deposition layer, which establish a mechanically stable connection between the foundation wafer and the covering. If the individual support element or support strut be space apart from one another by from several micrometer to several ten of micrometer, then on the one hand excessive sagging of the cover plate upon subjection to an overload be prevent, and on the other, the overall stability be increase substantially. It have furthermore prove advantageous to structure the seal layer as well by mean of a masked etching process. The etch process use can also include structure the deposition layer and optionally even far an upper layer of the foundation wafer, in particular of epipolysilicon. In a further advantageous feature of the method, the pressure inside the sensor chamber can be adjust by way of the pressure condition that prevail during the deposition of the seal layer. The process pressure prevail during the deposition of the seal layer will automatically become establish in the sensor chamber as well and be seal in there, while the seal layer be grow. Deposition process that can be consider for the sealing layer be sputter process( for metal layer) or PECVD process( for SiN, SiO, SiC, etc.). If the enclosed pressure should not prove identical to the deposition pressure, additional option still exist. Advantageously, to that end, before or during the deposition the sensor be subject to an inert gas, in particular helium, at a predetermined temperature that be introduce additionally into the deposition chamber. Because of the permeability of the deposition layer, a delayed pressure equalization can occur, and the fundamental diffusion process can be ascertain empirically. Since the suppression of the pressure equalization be achieve by apply the sealing layer at layer thickness of even only a few micrometer or less, the sealing can be do within relatively short time. Via the aforementioned method step of the invention, capacitive pressure sensor can also be make in an especially simple way. As a common feature, such pressure sensor have a differential capacitor array, which be join directly or via a couple element to the covering, so that sagging of the covering cause a change in the capacitance of the differential capacitor array, and this change in turn serf as a measurement variable. Further preferred feature of the invention will become apparent from the other characteristic recite in the dependent claim.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1-13 illustrate the production method accord to the invention for sensor, such as acceleration sensor or rotation rate sensor, and in particular also capacitive pressure sensor. The method step sketch in FIGS. 1-4 be already know from DE 195 37 814 A1 and will therefore be describe below only briefly. By definition, a subdivision of the sensor have already be make into a foundation wafer 11 and a thin-film sensor cap in the form of a cover 13. The foundation wafer 11 include all the component necessary for the function of the sensor, and in particular include contact region to be describe in further detail hereinafter, as well as micromechanical structure and electrode. The cover 13 by definition extends from a deposition layer to and include a sealing layer and serve the purpose of hermetically seal a sensor chamber, in which the micromechanical structure be locate. Onto a silicon substrate 10, an insulation layer 12, which enclose a conductive layer 14, be apply. Structuring of the two layer 12 and 14 can be do by know method step use in semiconductor technology, such as lithography and etching process and subsequent etch step. A polycrystalline silicon layer 16 of desire layer thickness be also apply, which cover the insulation layer 12. The silicon layer 16 typically comprise epipolysilicon, while the conductive layer 14 be shape of an optionally very highly doped polysilicon( FIG. 1). By application of a masking layer 18, a region 20 be define in which in later method step the micromechanical structure be to be create. First, the region be deepen( recess 20; FIG. 2) by a pre-etching step. In an ensue lithography step( FIG. 3), the thus-prestructured foundation wafer 11 be coat in the recess 20 with a mask 22 of photoresist, which in advance defines the sensor structure to be make, such as capacitive comb structure, spring, stop, electrode face, and perforation in a seismic mass. What be essential here be that the actual sensor structure be make with an adequately great space from the edge of the previously make recess 20, because there the precision of lithography and resolution be otherwise impair by the difference in topography. As can be see from FIG. 4, in the region not cover by the photoresist 22, trench 24, which extend as far as the insulation layer 12, be make by known, suitable etching process, such as in the manner describe in DE 42 41 045. In this way, individual structure 26 be insulate on the silicon layer 16. The design of such structure 26since it be knownwill not be address in further detail in conjunction with the present description. Next, sacrificial layer etching be do via the trench 24 in the region of the insulation layer 12, and a void be create( FIG. 5). The void the trench 24 together form a sensor chamber 28, in which the structure 26 be accommodate. The sacrificial layer etching can be do for instance via an HF vapor etch process, or dry sacrificial layer etch with silicon as the sacrificial layer in conjunction with a modify layer system. The resist mask 22 be remove before the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etch. In the case of dry sacrificial layer etch with silicon as the sacrificial layer, the mask layer 18 be remove after the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etch. The entire structure be fill, in the method step sketch in FIG. 6, with a silicon-based oxide 30, in particular a CVD oxide or a porous oxide. The preferably highly porous oxide 30 must be remove again at an extremely high etch rate use medium that contain hydrofluoric acid. The deposition condition for the oxide 30 should accordingly be select such that a low-grade oxide 30 of high porosity be create. These be at the same time the condition of deposition under which deposition be do at the high possible rate, which have the advantage of short oxide deposition time. The parameter for design the deposition condition of such low-grade oxide of high porosity be know from the prior art. For instance by mean of high plasma capacity, the desired oxide film 30 can be deposit during the deposition, at high process pressure and low substrate temperature( such as 200 C. to 300 C.). The next method step include a re-thinning of the oxide 30 to the height of the silicon layer 16( FIG. 7), which can be do for instance by grind( CMP or Chemo-Mechanical Polishing) or a well-known back-etching method. In the exemplary embodiment, the oxide 30 be remove down to the height of the layer 16. Next, a deposition layer 32, in particular of polysilicon, be deposit as a deposition layer over the entire surface( FIG. 8). To avoid compaction of the highly porous oxide 30, it be advantageous to keep the temperature as low as possible during this deposition. At the usual temperature for polysilicon deposition of 600 C. to 650 C., for instance, no significant compaction of the oxide 30 yet occurs. As an alternative, it be possible to perform a brief heating of the foundation wafer 11 to temperature of over 1000 C., without compact the oxide 30, if this heating be do only briefly( for instance for less than 10 minute). The tempering of the deposition layer 32 can advantageously be do with the aid of an RTP( Rapid Thermal Processing) or RTA( Rapid Thermal Annealing) reactor. If epipolysilicon be deposit as the deposition layer 32, then this deposition can be perform in an epitaxial reactor at a high deposition rate of up to 1 m/min, in order to keep the deposition time short. By mean of such a brief, high temperature treatment of the polysilicon, it can be attain for example that the layer 32 have a very high intrinsic tensile stress of over 200 MPa/m up to 1 GPa/m of layer thickness, for example, which be quite advantageous for apply the layer 32 as a cover 13. Because of this high tensile stress, the layer 32 can withstand even a high pressure apply from outside without bulge inward severely. In an ensue optional process step, the deposition layer 32 can be structure, for instance by etch( FIG. 9). In the final analysis, then only the region of the foundation wafer 11 among which the micromechanical structure 26 be later to be locate inside the sensor chamber 28 will be cover by the deposition layer 32. It be also possible to use the cover 13 unstructured. In that case, the cover 13 cover the entire wafer surface. The advantage then be that a planar surface of the wafer be preserve. By selective etching of the oxide 30 underneath the deposition layer 32, it be possible to expose the structure 26 again( FIG. 10). To that end, the deposition layer 32 must necessarily be permeable to the etch medium use and to the product create during the reaction. For instance, the polysilicon of the deposition layer 32 can be provide for this purpose with small etch opening by targeted etching, in a manner to be describe in further detail later herein. Depending on the type of etch process use, etch opening with diameter of 0.1 m to 5 m can be create. As an alternative, the deposition layer 32 can comprise a permeable polysilicon or a polysilicon that be make permeable retroactively by porosification, which allow the etch medium or reaction product to pass through. In conjunction with hydrofluoric acid vapor etch process, this variant have prove especially advantageous, since the hydrofluoric acid vapor can penetrate polysilicon especially easily, and diffusion event for the specie involve through the polysilicon can be speed up, especially at elevated temperature. The in-situ permeability of the polysilicon be especially high at low dopant concentration, as long as a long-lasting high-temperature treatment( temper) be avoid. It be also possible to employ a combination of HF liquid-phase etching and HF vapor etch to remove the sacrificial layer. In the wet etch phase( HF solution), the majority of the oxide 30 be first remove. In the ensue vapor etching, the remainder of the oxide 30 be remove without the risk of stick, result in an overall faster process. After the conclusion of the sacrificial layer etch process, the deposition layer 32 be hermetically close by deposition of a seal layer 34( FIG. 11). It have prove especially advantageous to apply a silicon nitride layer as the seal layer 34, because that can be deposit at even relatively low temperature of 300 C. to 400 C. in PECVD process. As an alternative, the sealing can also be do by deposit metal, such as aluminum, for which sputtering process be particularly well suit. Depending on the material chosen for the seal layer 34, a structuring of the cover 13 can then be do, for instance with the aid of photolithographic process. If the choose material be a metal( FIG. 12), then by mean of these structurings the contact pad 36 can simultaneously be form. In the case of a dielectric material, the seal layer 34 must be remove completely outside the capping region, and the contact pad 36 be apply( FIG. 13) in a separate method step to the silicon layer 16 or the deposition layer 32( if the latter be use unstructured over its full surface). The chosen layer thickness of the seal layer 34 depend essentially on the permeability, porosity, and diameter of the etch opening of the deposition layer 32, and it be understood that a thicker seal layer 34 be require for close the etching opening. FIGS. 14-16 show an alternative process course, begin with the deposition of the deposition layer 32 as show in FIG. 8. First, in the manner already explain, the oxide 30 be etch away through the deposition layer 32( FIG. 14). Next, by mean of the seal layer 34, the sensor chamber 28 be hermetically seal( FIG. 15). Once again, the layer thickness must be select to suit the property of the deposition layer 32, which be adjust for the sake of the passage of the etch medium or reaction product. Next, by a masked etching process show in FIG. 16, both the deposition layer 32 and the seal layer 34 be remove, and the contact pad be apply to the silicon layer 16 in a known manner. Overall, this make it possible to dispense with one mask plane, since the two layer 32, 34 be structure with one and the same mask. In the case where permeable polysilicon be use as the deposition layer 32, an adequate resistance must be assure after the structuring to prevent a diffusion of gas via the peripheral region. In practice, it have be find adequate if the permeable polysilicon layer overlap the epipolysilicon layer 16 by at least 50 m. In a further, already mention advantageous embodiment, the structuring of the deposition layer 32 and the cover layer 34 be omit until or until just before the deposition and structuring of the metal pad 36( see FIGS. 32-34, 34). Not until directly before the deposition of the metallize 36 be etch of the seal layer 34 perform, in the immediate region of the bond pad and around them, in order to make the bond region free of insulate layer. In an especially advantageous embodiment, the metal layer 36 for the bond pad simultaneously act as a seal layer 34. In this latter case, the seal layer 34, after be deposit over the full surface, must be open again around the bond pad, to enable through-etching of the deposition layer 32 there and thus the creation of electrically insulate contact pad 36. In a further variant, the epipolysilicon layer 16 be initially not yet etch through in the region of the contact pad 36, but instead be still present over the full surface. In the production of the sensor structure 26 by anisotropic deep etching, the bond region be accordingly initially not include. Not until the contact pad 36 be etch free, or in other word the deposition layer 32 and the seal layer 34, if the latter be not identical with the metallize layer of the contact pad 36, be etch through be the epipolysilicon layer 16 etch through, down to the bury oxide 12, around the bond pad. The same deep etching process can be employ for both the silicon layer 32 and for the epipolysilicon layer 16. Accordingly a double-trench process take place, in which a first deep trench be make for the sensor structure 26 themselves, and a second deep trench for the bond pad region be make later in the process sequence. In both variant, the electrical connection of the sensor structure 26 be effect via the contact pad 36 through the deposition layer 32 and the layer 16. The deposition layer 32 must accordingly have adequate electrical conductivity to enable large-area electrical contact, but in practice this be not a problem, give adequate doping, even if the deposition layer 32 be relatively thick. The aforementioned variant can be learn for the sake of illustration from FIGS. 32-34, in which a metal be use as the seal and bond pad, and FIG. 34, in which a dielectric be use as a seal and metal be use as the bond pad. The process step, sketch in FIGS. 15 and 11, in which the sealing layer 34 be apply can be use especially advantageously for adjust a desire internal pressure inside the sensor chamber 28. The adjustable pressure range include pressure from a few microbar up to atmospheric pressure. In contrast to the conventional method, because of the very rapid seal the tolerance in the pressure adjustment can be keep relatively low. For adjust the pressure, the procedure can be as follow: In an embodiment with a permeable deposition layer 32( one that be in-situ permeable, or be retroactively make porous to create permeability), after the foundation wafer 11, by then fully process up to the point of the application of the seal layer 34, be insert into a process chamber for deposition of the seal layer 34, heating be first do to a temperature between 300 C. and 450 C.; at the same time, instead of process gas, an inert gas be deliver to the process chamber at a give pressure. As the inert gas, helium be for instance suitable, since it can diffuse especially quickly through the deposition layer 32 that be either in-situ permeable or make permeable by porosification, so that in the sensor a rapid establishment of equilibrium( internal pressure equal outer pressure) be possible. Only after that be the process gas require for the deposition of the seal layer 34 supply and the deposition plasma ignite. If permeable polysilicon( in-situ permeable, or make permeable by porosification be use, then only a few second elapse in the time between the leave behind of the desired concluding pressure in the process chamber and the deposition of an adequately thick seal layer 34. For a know layer thickness and permeability of the deposition layer 32, the pressure change to be expect in this time can be calculate, so that suitable precaution can be plan for. It be also possible initially to leave the deposition pressure at the desire enclosed pressure for the capping, and already to start the deposition process early while still in the presence of the inert gas. Only after the initiation of the deposition process be the chamber pressure readjust to the pressure range that be actually optimal for the deposition. As a result, while the deposition process proceeds non-optimally for a few second and reach its most favorable operating range only after the pressure adaptation have be make, still proceed in this way mean that the time between leave the capping pressure and the complete hermetic sealing of the sensor element be shorten. For experimentally determine the enclosed pressure and monitor the method, the diaphragm bulging can be assess, for instance by interferometry, or quality parameter of the enclosed structure 26 can be ascertain by resonant excitation. Quality control for the method be also easily possible. It have prove to be especially favorable for this process course to be use to produce surface-micromechanical capacitive pressure sensor. FIGS. 17 and 18, on the one hand, and 19 and 20, on the other, accordingly show two possible embodiment of such pressure sensor. First, as show in FIGS. 17 and 19, a layer 32 that be permeable or be retroactively make permeable by etch be depositedoptionally in structure formabove the sensor chamber 28 that be fill with the oxide 30. Subsequent etch out of the oxide 30 and seal with the seal layer 34 lead to the application form show in FIGS. 18 and 20. In the first case, a torsion rocker 39 be implement in the pressure sensor; this rocker be connect to the cover 13 via a couple element 42. A seismic mass 38 be suspendedanalogously to a beam scalesymmetrically via torsion spring 40 and centrally with regard to both side. The mask 32 be perforate for the performance of the sacrificial layer etching; the perforation be not show here. After the deposition and planarization of the oxide 30, a hole be make in the oxide 30, somewhat outside the middle of the torsion rocker 39, use a photographic technique, and the oxide 30 be etch. Above it, the deposition layer 32 can for instance simply and advantageously be deposit as a permeable polysilicon layer, and/or it can be make permeable retroactively by etch process, such as porosification; in the contact hole previo sly place in the oxide 30 the silicon of the rocker 39 can be contact directly both mechanically and electrically. If an electrical insulation of the sensor diaphragm from the torsion rocker 39 be later desire for instance for the sake of electrical shielding from the environment then before the polysilicon be deposit an insulate layer can be deposit that be not attack by the HF vapor chemistry employ afterward for sacrificial oxide etch. An example of something suitable for this be a layer of amorphous silicon carbide which be resistant both to medium that contain hydrofluoric acid and to HF vapor. This layer can be structure after the conformal deposition above the contact hole in the oxide either by a masked etch process such that only the coupling element 42 remains or can be machine in such a way that after a grinding process the couple element 42 remains enclose by the oxide 30. It be understood that in that case the order of the process step can also be reverse; that be the couple element 42( for instance of amorphous silicon carbide) be apply first and then the filler oxide be deposit and planarized and then the entire covering 13 be deposit and planarized take into account the pressure adjustment process parameter set beforehand. By the two production variant for the coupling element 42that be simple polysilicon deposition with mechanical connection via the polysilicon which it be understood fill up the contact hole in the oxide 30 and thus establish the nonpositive engagement with the rocker 39 or the explicit deposition and production of an electrically insulated couple element 42 by mean of an addition layera mechanical connection be create between the cover 13 and the torsion rocker 39. Because of the bend form of the cover 13 that be subject to pressure it be advantageous to place the coupling element 42 between the torsion axis and the center of the cover plate or accordingly for exampleas see in FIGS. 17 18to the right of the torsion axis of the rocker 39 and to the left of the middle of the diaphragm. If pressure be exert on the diaphragm a bending line in the form of a double-S ensues which press the right-hand half of the rocker 39 downward and the left-hand half of the rocker 39 accordingly move upward. If there be two counterelectrodes( structure from the conductive layer 14) underneath the rocker 39 then the change in capacitance can be process as a differential capacitance by mean of suitable evaluation electronics. The electrical wiring of the sensor component be do in the bottom plane through the conductive layer 14 bury there. Such a sensor with the layout described have an advantageously low temperature drift because of its symmetry and the capacitive assessment by the differential capacitor array make it possible to dispense with an expensive calibration and temperature compensation. If the explicit differential capacitor array be dispense then a simpler process and design in accordance with FIGS. 19 and 20 can be consider. The seismic mass 44 be join directly to the deposition layer 32. Also in the way describe above a reference pressure preferably by mean of helium gas can be enclose in the sensor chamber 28 and the structure can be hermetically seal by seal of the seal layer 34. If pressure be exert on the structure the mass 44 be press downward thus decrease the spacing from the layer 14 lying below which function as a counterelectrode and a change in capacitance accordingly ensue. The electrical connection and the embodiment of the counterpart electrode can in turn be accomplish via the layer 14 and extend to the outside. One thus obtain a simple robust capacitive pressure sensor by mean of surface micromechanics. The evaluation electronics develop in standard form for acceleration sensor can continue to be use if a differential capacitor array be embody by a fixed-value capacitor connect externally to the measuring capacitor. The permeability of the deposition layer 32 for the etch medium and the resultant reaction product can also be force retroactively after deposition of the layer 32. A first method of this kind be sketch in FIGS. 21-23 in which an electrochemical etching operation be primarily use for convert silicon into( permeable) porous silicon. Firstas already describedthe procedure be the same up to and include the deposition of the deposition layer 32. Next a suitable masking layer 46 be apply( FIG. 21) and in a known manner such as by an additional lithography step structuring be perform so that a region 48 in which the property of the layer 32 be to be vary or modify be make accessible( FIG. 22). The actual electrochemical etching operation be perform in the presence of an HF electrolyte such as a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol and lead to the formation of porous structure or etch opening in the region 48 of the layer 32 that be expose to the electrolyte. It have prove especially advantageous in the electrochemical etch operation of the type describe to perform an irradiation of the surface in addition in a wavelength range from 100 nm to 1000 nm and in particular 350 nm to 800 nm since the homogeneity of the process be improve thereby. An electrical connection by application of an anodic potential can be do on the one hand via the top side of the layer 32 and on the other from the epipolysilicon layer 16 or the foundation wafer 11( back-side contact) via the underside of the layer 32. The large-area back-side contact via the foundation wafer 11 have the advantage that with it a better-defined more-homogeneous distribution of current density of the anodize current be achieve since the current have to overcome a maximum of only the thickness of the foundation wafer 11 in order to reach the region 48 to be treat. Expediently a high n-doping of the layer of the foundation wafer 11above all the wafer underside of the substrate( 10) be provide( n++) which become possible especially simply by POCL deposition and ensue forcing of phosphorous into the silicon but also by ion implantation of phosphorous arsenic or antimony. The n++ doping of the back side of the foundation wafer 11 reduce the Schottky barrier that be present in the electrolyte/silicon contact region. Suitably adapt doping of the layer 32 in the region 48 that be to be vary can be use to control the process. It have be demonstrate for instance that p-doping lead to the formation of mesoporous pore while n-doping lead to etch opening range from a few ten of nanometer to micrometer. Alternatively to the electrochemical etching operation the procedure can be as show in FIGS. 24-27 for exemplary embodiment. First the still inadequately permeable layer 32 be apply and next use know mask method a metal layer be deposit and structure. In the ensue galvanic production of porous polysilicon in the region 48 the metal thus simultaneously take on the function both of mask the silicon surface of the layer 32 in the region that be not to be electrochemically anodize and of a cathode in the galvanic silicon/electrolyte/metal cell. The process that lead to the formation of the porous polysilicon can be control via the composition of the HF electrolyte and via the incident current density in this galvanic cell. The current density be dependent on the ratio of area of metal to silicon. The large the metal area the high the current density. Typical metal to silicon area ratio be between 10 and 20 to 1. The advantage of this technique be that electrical contacting of the wafer be not necessary. To achieve these ratio part of the metal face of the region 48 which be to be make porous of the cover 13 can be cover with a grid. Care should be take that the width of the metal track be great than the thickness of the layer 32 to be etch because otherwise excessive underetching and detachment of the metal could occur. A selection among possible embodiment can be learn from the plan view and sectional view of FIGS. 24-27. It be also conceivable by a modified stain-etch operation to treat the region 48 that be to be make porous with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid nitric acid and water. All the other region must be protect with a suitable masking layer for instance of silicon nitride. By way of the composition and in particular the nitric acid concentration and the exposure time the porosity and layer thickness of the modify porous silicon region can be control. Moreover there be an empirically detectable influence of dopants make it possible to control the process that create the porosity. A further alternative embodiment of the thin-film sensor cap in which support element 50 be present on the underside of the deposition layer 32 can be see in FIGS. 28-31. Up to the deposition of the oxide 30 as show in FIG. 6 the method describe at the outset can be employ. However a complete planarization of the oxide film 30 down to the height of the epipolysilicon layer 16 be dispense with. Instead a structured removal of material be do in which the oxide 30 be remove from those region that be later to form the support elements 50. These region be logically locate above the region of the epipolysilicon layer 16 which be not suppose to be further attack in the ensue etching process. The individual support element 50 be typically encompass support strut or support column which thus define the sensor chamber 28 that be cover by the cover 13. The necessary micromechanical structure 26 be locate inside the sensor chamber 28. In accordance with FIG. 28 slight spacing of the support elements 50 and thus slight clamp width of the cover 13 can be achieve. Clamping width below 10 m be thus feasible. However this also mean reduced sag upon subjection to an overpressure and the spacing of the cover 13 and the sensor element can be reduce so much that it be impossible to lift the sensor structure 26 out in the event of a mechanical overload. Since the bond frame necessary in the conventional sensor can be drastically reduce in size a major reduction in surface area additional ensues so that more than twice as many acceleration sensor can be process on the same foundation wafer 11. FIG. 31 in this respect show a far advantageous embodiment with T-shaped support element 50 which lead to especially stable structure. For the case where instead of use a permeable polysilicon as the deposition layer 32 etch opening 52 by way of which the sacrificial oxide etch take place be to be make retroactively the design show in FIG. 2 have prove advantageous. The etching opening 52 be dispose here such that upon the deposition of the seal layer 34 at most the structural element 53 of the sensor that be not fundamental to its function be expose to the deposition plasma. These structural element 53 that be not fundamental to the function be in fact precisely those element that be connect to the support elements 50. After the sacrificial etching it be optionally possible via the etch opening 52 to deposit suitable anti-adhesion layer in the region of the structure 26 as well. A sensor in accordance with FIG. 30 can be make with the aid of the process step describe above. Along with the possibility describe in conjunction with FIGS. 15 and 16 of simultaneously structure both the deposition layer 32 and the layer 34 or of initially not structure the deposition layer 32 and initially leave it over the full surface and only at the end etch contact pad 36 that be electrically insulate from the system it be also possible to machine the epipolysilicon layer 16 locate beneath so that the opening 54 by way of which contact can later be do can be create in one process step. In electrochemical etch contacting in turn occur via the back side of the wafer. The layer be then electrically connect via the support elements 50 so that a preferably high permeability be establish in the region of the support element 50 by the formation of porous silicon. This electrical contacting of the layer 32 can also be do next to the sensor region 28 toward the substrate 10. ''"

BACKGROUND A memory chip generally comprise a plurality of memory cell that be deposit onto a silicon wafer and addressable via an array of column conduct lead( bit line) and row conduct lead( word line). Typically, a memory cell be situate at the intersection of a bit line and a word line. The memory cell be control by specialized circuit that perform function such as identify row and column from which data be read from or to which data be write. Typically, each memory cell store data in the form of a 1 or a 0, represent a bit of data. An array of magnetic memory cell can be refer to as a magnetic random access memory or MRAM. MRAM be generally nonvolatile memory( i.e., a solid state chip that retain data when power be turn off). At least one type of magnetic memory cell include a data layer and a reference layer, separate from each other by at least one intermediate layer. The data layer may also be refer to as a bit layer, a storage layer, or a sense layer. In a magnetic memory cell, a bit of data( e.g., a 1 or 0) may be store by write into the data layer via one or more conducting lead( e.g., a bit line and a word line). A typical data layer might be make of one or more ferromagnetic material. The write operation be typically accomplished via one or more write current that set the orientation of the magnetic moment in the data layer to a predetermine direction( hereinafter magnetic orientation). Once write, the stored bit of data may be read by provide a read current through one or more conducting lead( e.g., a read line) to the magnetic memory cell. For each memory cell, the magnetic orientation of the data layer and the reference layer be either parallel( in the same direction) or anti-parallel( in different direction) to each other. The degree of parallelism affect the resistance of the cell, and this resistance can be determine by sense( e.g., via a sense amplifier) an output current or voltage produce by the memory cell in response to the read current. More specifically, if the magnetic orientation be parallel, the resistance determine base on the output current be of a first relative value( e.g., relatively low). If the magnetic orientation be anti-parallel, the resistance determine be of a second relative value( e.g., relatively high). The relative value of the two state( i.e., parallel and anti-parallel) be typically different enough to be sense distinctly. A 1 or a 0 may be assign to the respective relative resistance value depend on design specification. The intermediate layer, which may also be refer to as a spacer layer, may comprise insulate material( e.g., dielectric), non-magnetic conduct material, and/or other known material. The various conduct lead which be use to address the memory cell( e.g., bit line, word line, and read line), and to provide current to pass through the data and reference layer to read data from or write data to the memory cell be provide by one or more additional layer, call conduct layer( s). The layer describe above and their respective characteristic be typical of magnetic memory cell base on tunnel magnetoresistance( TMR) effect know in the art. Other combination of layer and characteristic may also be use to make magnetic memory cell base on TMR effect. Still other configuration of magnetic memory cell be base on other well know physical effect( e.g., giant magnetoresistance( GMR), anisotropic magnetoresistance( AMR), colossal magnetoresistance( CMR), and/or other physical effect). Throughout this application, various exemplary embodiment will be describe in reference to the TMR memory cell as first describe above. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the exemplary embodiment may also be implement with other type of magnetic memory cell know in the art( e.g., other type of TMR memory cell, GMR memory cell, AMR memory cell, CMR memory cell, etc.) accord to the requirement of a particular implementation. The relative resistance between a reference layer and a data layer of a magnetic memory cell may be more efficiently and definitively ascertain if the magnetic orientation of the reference layer can be pinned-on-the-fly( i.e., by apply a current to pin the reference layer to a know magnetic orientation when one wish to read a bit). Various exemplary embodiment of pinned-on-the-fly reference layer be describe in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,404,674, issue to Anthony et al. and assign to the assignee of the present application. This patent be hereby incorporate by reference for all purpose. One way to make magnetic memory cell with reference layer that can be pinned-on-the-fly be to make the reference layer magnetically soft( i.e., layer whose magnetic orientation be easy to switch). Thus, a market exist for magnetic memory cell have reference layer whose magnetic orientation be easy to switch.

Magnetic Memory Cells Having Soft Reference Layers A. Overview of Soft Magnetic Behavior A layer of magnetic material be say to exhibit soft magnetic behavior when its magnetic orientation can be reversibly switch by a small magnetic field. A layer of magnetic material may be soft as a result of its chemical composition, size, shape, or even the temperature of the material during measurement. A superparamagnetic material be one example of a magnetic material that can be ultra-soft. An ultra-soft material generally have no set magnetic orientation when no magnetic field be be apply. The ultra-soft material have extremely low coercivity and may only require a very small amount of magnetic field to switch its magnetic orientation one way or another. B. Applying Soft Magnetic Materials to Magnetic Memory Cells Soft magnetic material be useful in magnetic memory cell to improve switch characteristic of the memory cell. For example, a soft data layer generally require a low switch current than a hard data layer during a write operation. However, the data layer should not be too soft. It be desirable to make the data layer hard enough to retain the magnetic orientation write into the layer. Many us of the soft magnetic material in magnetic memory cell have be disclose in U.S. Pat. No. 6,404,674( issue to Anthony et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,538,917( issue to Tran et al.), which be hereby incorporate by reference for all purpose. C. Applying Soft Magnetic Materials to Reference Layers in Magnetic Memory Cells In a magnetic memory cell implement a soft reference layer( as oppose to a pin or hard reference layer), the coercivity of the reference layer be typically much low than the coercivity of the data layer. For example, in many exemplary magnetic memory cell, the coercivity of the data layer might be 2-5 time great than the coercivity of the reference layer. When implement a soft reference layer in a magnetic memory cell, the reference layer can be set into a know magnetic orientation with small magnetic field generate by current provide by conductor adjacent to the magnetic memory cell. Such current be low than the switch current need to write a bit in the data layer. Lower current consumption may result in reduced operate power. D. Making a Reference Layer Soft by Reducing Its Magnetic Energy In a magnetically soft layer, very small magnetic field( or current) can cause the magnetic orientation in the layer to change direction. If use appropriately, this attribute can be desirable in the reference layer. Generally, a magnetic material be render soft by reduce its magnetic energy, which be proportional to K, the sum of all anisotropy of the magnetic layer( typically anisotropy include, without limitation, shape anisotropy, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and magnetoelastic anisotropy). When magnetic element be pattern to sub-micrometer dimension, shape anisotropy often dominate, so controlling shape anisotropy be important in create a soft, pattern magnetic element. 1. Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Shape Anisotropy When design a soft reference layer, one may consider make a layer with a small shape anisotropy. In general, the small the difference between major and minor ax of a planar shape, the small the shape anisotropy. For example, a circle, whose major and minor ax be equal to its diameter d, have no shape anisotropy. A square of width d have a small shape anisotropy than a rectangle of width d. As the dimension of a layer become small, the shape anisotropy( Ks) of an elongated shape increase rapidly. Thus, reduce shape anisotropy( e.g., by adapt circular shape) be especially beneficial for small patterned layer. 2. Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Choice of ferromagnetic alloy can also be an important consideration when create a soft reference layer. The magnetic field require to saturate the magnetization along an applied field axis be generally proportional to the magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, implement low magnetocrystalline anisotropy in a soft reference layer may allow the magnetization of the soft reference layer to respond to lower magnetic field. Larger field be necessary to alter magnetization orientation in high anisotropy material. Examples of material have low magnetocrystalline anisotropy include NiFe, CoFe, and amorphous ferromagnetic alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb). 3. Reducing Magnetic Energy in a Reference Layer by Reducing Volume As the volume V of a patterned magnetic layer be reduce, the total magnetic energy, KV, of the layer decrease and eventually approach the thermal energy, kBT, of the layer. Here kB be the Boltzmann constant and T be the absolute temperature. When the ratio of magnetic energy to thermal energy( KV/kBT) in a layer of material be less than a threshold value( e.g., about 50), the layer of material may become less thermally stable and its magnetic orientation may become susceptible to reorientation due to thermal fluctuation. One manifestation of the onset of thermal instability be a reduction in coercivity, which can be use to advantage in a soft-reference layer. Further reduction of the volume of a layer( e.g., reduce the ratio between KV and kBT to about 5), may place the layer in a superparamagnetic, ultra-soft, state. Prior to reach the superparamagnetic state, thermal energy may facilitate switching of magnetic orientation, make the layer softer. Based on the foregoing, reduce the volume of a layer( e.g., by reduce its area and/or thickness) may be consider in the design of a soft reference layer. Patterning the soft reference layer into a thinner layer( especially in combination with a small circular shape) may make the reference layer ultra-soft. Of course, one can also use any combination of the above technique to create a soft reference layer depend on the specific requirement of a particular implementation. Sections III-V below illustrate exemplary magnetic memory cell apply one or more of the above technique to reduce magnetic energy in the reference layer and render it magnetically soft. Sections VI-VIII below describe process for make those exemplary magnetic memory cell. E. What About the Data Layer? The data layer may be pattern differently than the reference layer so that the data layer may maintain its magnetic hardness by, for example, have a large shape anisotropy or volume. This may be desirable to ensure that the data layer will retain its magnetic orientation once write. III. A First Exemplary Memory Cell FIG. 1 illustrate an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 100 have a soft reference layer. Generally, a memory cell may be make as top-pinned( where the reference layer be on top of the data layer) or bottom-pinned( where the reference layer be below the data layer). For ease of explanation, only the top-pinned configuration be show in FIG. 1 and reference in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein. However, this configuration be merely illustrative. Thus, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other configuration( e.g., bottom-pinned, etc.) may also be implement use the exemplary process disclose herein in accordance with any particular design requirement. The memory cell 100 include a data layer 110, a spacer layer 120, and a reference layer 130. The reference layer 130 have a low magnetic energy than the data layer 110. The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor( not show) that be orthogonal to each other and be collectively use for both write and read operation. In some implementation, one or more conductor may also be consider as a part of the magnetic memory cell 100. One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration as illustrate in FIG. 1 be merely illustrative. Other configuration, for example, configuration have additional layer be also know in the art. For example, another magnetic memory cell configuration may also include a seed layer, a protective cap layer, and/or other layer. The seed layer generally enhance crystalline alignment of other nearby ferromagnetic layer( s). Exemplary material for a seed layer include Ta, Ru, NiFe, Cu, or combination of these material. The protective cap layer protect the data layer 110 from the environment( e.g., by reduce oxidation of the data layer 110) and may be form use any suitable material know in the art, for example, Ta, TaN, Cr, Al or Ti. For ease of explanation, these additional layer be not show in the Figures; however, magnetic memory cell have one or more of these additional layer may be implement with various embodiment to be describe herein in accordance with a particular design choice. The data layer 110 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 110 include, without limitation, NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and still other material. The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material, or multiple layer separate by non-magnetic layer. In an exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 120 be a tunnel barrier layer( e.g., if the memory cell 100 be a TMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 120 may be make of SiOx, SiNx, MgO, AlOx, AlNx, TaOx, and/or other insulate material. In another exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 120 be a non-magnetic conducting layer( e.g., if the memory cell 100 be a GMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 120 may be make of Cu, Au, Ag, and/or other non-magnetic conducting material. The reference layer 130 may comprise a single layer of material or multiple layer of material. For example, the reference layer 130 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the reference layer 130 include NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous ferromagnetic alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and other material. The reference layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material, or multiple layer separate by non-magnetic layer. In an exemplary implementation, the data layer 110 be thicker( and thus have a great volume) than the reference layer 130. The magnetization state of such a data layer 110 would be more thermally stable than a reference layer 130 of the same cross-sectional area and make of the same material. More generally, the data layer and the reference layer may be make of the same or different material and size. In an exemplary implementation, the data layer 110, spacer 120, and the reference layer 130 be pattern to a circular, or a low aspect ratio oval, elliptical, and/or other rounded shape that provide a relatively small shape anisotropy for the reference layer 130 and the data layer 110. In this implementation, the aspect ratio, define as length divide by width, can be less than 2. If the volume of reference layer be make sufficiently small through a combination of small planar area and film thickness, then the reference layer can become superparamagnetic. In this case the reference layer magnetization can be orient by a very small magnetic field. In an exemplary implementation, the data layer 110 have a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy than the reference layer 130, thereby render the data layer 110 magnetically hard. Hence, one level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization in the reference layer, and another high level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization of the data layer. An exemplary process for make the memory cell 100 will be describe in Section VI below. IV. A Second Exemplary Magnetic Memory Cell FIG. 2 illustrate an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 200. The magnetic memory cell 200 include a large volume( e.g., wider and thicker) data layer 210 relative to the soft reference layer 230. This configuration may provide a more magnetically stable data layer 210 and may reduce the effect of the fringe demagnetize field emanate from the edge of the data layer 210 from affect the switch magnetic field of the reference layer 230. Typically, fringe demagnetize field from one layer will increase the required switching magnetic field of another layer. However, an offset at the edge between the layer( e.g., make one layer slightly small than the other) may reduce the effect of fringe demagnetize field from the large layer on the small layer. For ease of explanation, only the top-pinned configuration be show in FIG. 2 and reference to in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein. One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration as illustrate in FIG. 2 be merely illustrative. Other configuration, for example, configuration have additional conductor( s) and/or configuration have other additional layer be also know in the art. For ease of explanation, additional layer be not show in the Figure; however, magnetic memory cell have one or more additional layer may be implement with various embodiment to be describe herein in accordance with a particular design choice. Further, a person skilled in the art will readily recognize that the shape of the layer 210-230 in a memory cell be merely illustrative. The shape at which a layer be be pattern depend upon the masking process. Thus, during a particular masking process, the shape of one or more layer in the memory cell may be make different than another layer of the memory cell by apply an additional etching step( e.g., plasma etching, wet etching, etc.) to etch such one or more layer and/or a heating step to cause the mask layer to change shape( e.g., by cause reflow of the mask layer material) before resume etch of such one or more layer. Returning now to FIG. 2, the memory cell 200 include a data layer 210, a spacer layer 220, and a reference layer 230. The reference layer 230 have a low magnetic energy than the data layer 210. The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor( not show) that be orthogonal to each other and be collectively use for both write and read operation. The data layer 210 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 210 include, without limitation, NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and still other material. The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material, or multiple layer separate by non-magnetic layer. In an exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 220 be a tunnel barrier layer( e.g., if the memory cell 200 be a TMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 220 may be make of SiOx, SiNx, MgO, AlOx, AlNx, TaOx, and/or other insulate material. In another exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 220 be a non-magnetic conducting layer( e.g., if the memory cell 200 be a GMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 220 may be make of Cu, Au, Ag, and/or other non-magnetic conducting material: The reference layer 230 may comprise a single layer of material or multiple layer of material. For example, the reference layer 230 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the reference layer 230 include NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous ferromagnetic alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and other material. The reference layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material, or multiple layer separate by non-magnetic layer. In an exemplary implementation, the data layer 210 have a large planar area than the reference layer 230. The magnetization state of such a data layer 210 would be more thermally stable than a soft reference layer 230 of the same thickness and make of the same material. While FIG. 2 indicate that spacer layer 220 and reference layer 230 have the same shape, it be not necessary to the design of the memory cell. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the size and shape of the spacer layer 220 and the reference layer 230 can vary depend on design choice. In an exemplary implementation, the spacer layer 220 and the reference layer 230 be pattern to a circular, or a low aspect ratio( e.g., less than 2) oval, elliptical, and/or other shape that provide a relatively small shape anisotropy for the reference layer 230. The data layer 210 be pattern to an oval, elliptical, rectangular, and/or other shape that have a large planar area than the reference layer 230. If the volume of reference layer be make sufficiently small through a combination of small planar area and film thickness, then the reference layer can become superparamagnetic. In this case the reference layer magnetization can be orient by a very small magnetic field. In an exemplary implementation, data layer 210 have a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy than reference layer 230, thereby render data layer 210 magnetically hard. Hence, one level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization in the reference layer, and another high level of magnetic field may orient the magnetization of the data layer. An exemplary process for make the memory cell 200 will be describe in Section VII below. V. A Third Exemplary Magnetic Memory Cell FIG. 3 illustrate an elevation view of an exemplary magnetic memory cell 300. The magnetic memory cell 300 include a large volume( e.g., large planar area) data layer 310 relative to the soft reference layer 330. This configuration may provide a more magnetically stable data layer 310 and may reduce the effect of the fringe demagnetize field emanate from the edge of the data layer 310 from affect the switch magnetic field of the reference layer 330. For ease of explanation, only the top-pinned configuration be show in FIG. 3 and reference to in the description of various exemplary embodiment herein. One skilled in the art will recognize that the memory cell configuration as illustrate in FIG. 3 be merely illustrative. Other configuration, for example, configuration have additional conductor( s) and/or configuration have other additional layer be also know in the art. For ease of explanation, additional layer be not show in the Figure; however, magnetic memory cell have one or more additional layer may be implement with various embodiment to be describe herein in accordance with a particular design choice. Referring now to FIG. 3, the memory cell 300 include a data layer 310, a spacer layer 320, and a reference layer 330. The reference layer 330 have a low magnetic energy than the data layer 310. The data and reference layer typically make contact with a pair of respective conductor( not show) that be orthogonal to each other and be collectively use for both write and read operation. The data layer 310 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the data layer 310 include, without limitation, NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and still other material. The data layer can be a single layer of ferromagnetic material, or multiple layer separate by non-magnetic layer. In an exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 320 be a tunnel barrier layer( e.g., if the memory cell 300 be a TMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 320 may be make of SiOx, SiNx, MgO, AlOx, AlNx, TaOx, and/or other insulate material. In another exemplary embodiment, the spacer layer 320 be a non-magnetic conducting layer( e.g., if the memory cell 300 be a GMR memory cell). In this embodiment, the spacer layer 320 may be make of Cu, Au, Ag, and/or other non-magnetic conducting material. Each reference layer 330 may comprise a single layer of material or multiple layer of material. For example, the reference layer 330 may comprise one or more ferromagnetic material. In an exemplary embodiment, ferromagnetic material suitable for the reference layer 330 include NiFe, NiFeCo, CoFe, amorphous ferromagnetic alloy( e.g., CoFeB, CoZrNb), and other material.

In FIG. 6D a reference layer 330 be form on the patterned spacer layer 320 by deposition and/or other technique know in the art( e.g. via sputter evaporation chemical vapor deposition atomic layer deposition( ALD) and/or other know technique).

The reference layer material in many magnetic memory cell be polycrystalline. Grain boundary in polycrystalline material typically be disorder and can have property different from the bulk grain( e.g. result in a different etch rate or a different reaction rate than the bulk grain). If a polycrystalline reference layer be expose to an etchant or reactant grain boundary can be remove or render magnetically inactive thus form small isolated reference layer dot. This isolation technique can be far facilitate by deposit polycrystalline grain that be dome-shaped( e.g. thicker at the center of a grain than at the grain 's boundary). In this case the grain boundary be thin than the bulk of the grain thereby simplify the preferential removal or reaction of grain boundary material.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other type of memory cell( e.g. GMR memory cell etc.) may be construct accord to the requirement of a particular implementation. For example the spacer layer 320 may be a non-magnetic conducting layer for construct a GMR memory cell. IX. Other Considerations A magnetically soft layer be characterize by relative ease of switch its magnetic orientation. For example the magnetic orientation of a thin and small soft reference layer that be isolate from other magnetic layer( i.e. free from fringe demagnetize field from those other magnetic layer) can be easily switch by apply small magnetic field. However in practice due to counter effect of demagnetize field from other nearby magnetic layer( e.g. data layer) that small and thin soft reference layer will require high magnetic field to switch its magnetic orientation. Thus when design various layer in magnetic memory cell one have to take into consideration fringe demagnetize field generate by nearby magnetic layer during operation. Depending on design choice the fringe demagnetize field from a nearby magnetic layer( e.g. the data layer) may be reduce by:( 1) providing yet another nearby magnetic layer to create a flux guide for the magnetic field generate by the nearby magnetic layer( e.g. a ferromagnetic cladding around a conductor);( 2) offset the soft reference layer from the edge of the nearby magnetic layer by at least a small margin as show in FIGS. 2 and 3 above;( 3) make the nearby magnetic layer a multi-layer magnetic layer that can capture its own fringe demagnetize field; and/or( 4) apply other know technique in accordance with the requirement of a particular implementation or design choice. X. Conclusion The foregoing example illustrate certain exemplary embodiment from which other embodiment variation and modification will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The invention should therefore not be limit to the particular embodiment discuss above but rather be define by the claim. ''"

Thus, the light-shielding film 34 be identical in electrical potential with the substrate 1. A protecting film 35, e.g., an SiN film, be form on the surface of the light-shielding film 34. The protecting film 35 have a film thickness of approximately 1.6 m. The protecting film 35 be not provide on the electrode pattern 29. Thus, the electrode pattern 29 be in an uncovered condition. None of the light-shielding film 34 and the protecting film 35 be provide on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4. Thus, the anti-reflection film 30 be directly expose to the incoming light. FIG. 1 be a plan view show a schematic arrangement of the above-described photo sense integrate circuit. The photo diode 4 be dispose at a center of the substrate 1. The photo diode 4 be surround by an element arrange region 36 for accommodate the signal processing circuit element include the IIL element 5 and the bipolar transistor 6. The upper surface of the element arrange region 36 be cover by the above-described light-shielding film 34. The light-shielding film 34 overhangs the element arrange region 36 so as to extend from an edge of the element arrange region 36 by a predetermined distance. The light-shielding film 34 be provide with an opening 34 a for uncover the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4. A plurality of electrode pad 8, electrically connect to various circuit element dispose in the element arrange region 36, be position at a region not cover by the light-shielding film 34 on an out peripheral portion of the substrate 1. In the same manner, the thin-film resistor 27 and the aluminum electrode pattern 37 a and 37 b electrically connect to this thin-film resistor 27 be dispose outside the light-shielding film 34. Next, a manufacture method of the above-described photo sense integrate circuit will be explain. First, n-type embed layer 9, 14 and 21 be form on the p type silicon substrate 1 have a surface azimuth( 100). Then, diffusion embedding be perform as a preparation for form the p+ type separate diffusion region 3. Subsequently, the n type epitaxial layer 2 be form on the substrate 1. Then, the p+ type separate diffusion region 3 be form by perform the separate diffusing for form the element form region 4 a, 5 a, 6 a, 7 a and 8 a. The impurity be dope into each element form region by selectively perform the diffusion. In this case, the photo diode 4 and the IIL 5 have manufacturing process commonly perform. For example, the n+ type diffusion region 10 and 11 of the photo diode 4 can be simultaneously form with the n+ type diffusion region 15 and 16 of the IIL 5. Regarding other diffusion region, the ordinary IC manufacturing process can be use for dope the impurity. After form the diffusion region of the above-described element, the p+ type diffusion region 12 of the photo diode 4 be form by use an ion-implantation method. The p+ type impurity have a predetermined density be dope at a predetermined depth to form a p-n junction. Next, to form the thin-film resistor 27, a CrSi layer be coat on the oxide film 26 form on the surface of the substrate 1 by sputter etc. The coated CrSi layer be configure into a predetermined shape by use photolithographic patterning. Subsequently, a required number of opening be form at predetermined portion on the oxide film 26 by use the photolithographic patterning. Then, an aluminum( or AlSi) layer of approximately 1.1 m be coat by sputter etc. The coated aluminum layer be shape into the predetermined electrode pattern 28 by use a photolithographic patterning. In this case, no etching be apply to the aluminum leave on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4. The remain aluminum act as a protector for the anti-reflection film 30. Therefore, the anti-reflection film 30 be not damage during succeed manufacturing process. At the final manufacturing step, this aluminum layer be remove off the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4. Next, as an insulating film use for the flattening processing, the first TEOS film 31 have a film thickness of approximately 200 nm be form by use a CVD method. The SOG layer 32, e.g., BPSG( Boron-Phosphor-Silicate Glass), be apply on the first TEOS film 31 to smoothen the recessed or stepped portion. Then, the second TEOS film 33 have a film thickness of approximately 700 nm be form on the SOG layer 32 by use a CVD method. With the formation of these laminate insulating layer, the recessed or stepped portion form during the aluminum wire pattern can be flatten so as to leave a smooth surface. Thereafter, an opening corresponding to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 be provide on each of the first TEOS film 31 and the second TEOS film 33. The aluminum coat apply to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 be expose through this opening. Then, the light-shielding film 34 of AlSi have a film thickness of approximately 1.3 m be coat on the second TEOS film 33 by sputter. Then, a photolithographic patterning be apply on the light-shielding film 34 so as to form the opening 34 a corresponding to the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 and expose the electrode pad 8 and the thin-film resistor 27( refer to FIG. 1). Thus, the patterned light-shielding film 34 cover or conceals the element arrange region 36. Next, the protecting film 35 of SiN have a film thickness of approximately 1.6 m be form on the light-shielding film 34 by use a CVD method. Then, a photolithographic patterning be apply on the protecting film 35. More specifically, the SiN film 35 be remove off the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 and from the electrode pad 8 by apply dry etching. Finally, the aluminum coating leave on the light-receiving face of the photo diode 4 be remove off by etch. The manufactured photo sense integrate circuit device( hereinafter, refer to a chip) be then subject to an electric output performance check and adjustment. More specifically, a laser beam be irradiate on a planar pattern( refer to FIG. 1) of the thin-film resistor 27 to perform predetermined trim processing. The thin-film resistor 27 be trim by partly burn and cut the thin-film resistor 27. Preferably, a YAG laser may be use for form a cutout T on the thin-film resistor 27, as a rough adjustment as show in FIG. 1. The cutout T extend from an edge of the thin-film resistor 27 inward in a lateral direction. And, after advance a predetermined distance, the cutout T turn perpendicularly to a longitudinal direction of the thin-film resistor 27. During the cutting operation, the electric performance of the chip be monitor. The size of the cutout T be adjust in accordance with the monitored value so as to obtain desirable characteristic. In the above-described chip, the light-shielding film 34 be form by an aluminum-group metallic film. Thus, a capacitance coupling be form between the light-shielding film 34 and the aluminum wiring pattern 28 as show in FIG. 3. This possibly cause an error in operation due to a parasitic capacitance. According to this embodiment, the light-shielding film 34 be electrically connect to the substrate 1 at the predetermined portion 34 b via the aluminum electrode pattern 28 a. With this arrangement, the light-shield film 34 be equalize in electrical potential with the substrate 1. This be effective to eliminate any adverse influence give from an electric power source voltage or from extraneous noise etc. Furthermore, set the electrical potential of the light-shielding film 34 and the substrate 1 to a ground potential be effective in that the light-shielding film 34 can function as an electric shielding film. This provide a stabilized detecting operation. The silicon substrate 1, use in this embodiment, have a surface azimuth define by( 100) because the performance of the photo diode 4 can be improve. When compare with a silicon substrate have a surface azimuth( 111), the silicon substrate 1 have the surface azimuth( 100) be advantageous in that a dark current level be reduce because of its small surface level density. When an operating temperature be increase, the characteristic bring by the difference in the surface azimuth become apparent. FIG. 4 show the result of a test conduct by the inventor on a total of 25 sample for each silicon substrate under an ambient temperature of 100 C. An average value of the measure dark current be approximately 0.62 nA( 3=0.19 nA) when the sample have a surface azimuth( 100). On the other hand, an average value of the measure dark current be approximately 1.25 nA( 3=0.18 nA) when the sample have a surface azimuth( 111). In short, the dark current can be reduce to a half level by use the substrate 1 have a surface azimuth( 100) of this embodiment, compare with a substrate have a surface azimuth( 100). In this test, a light-receiving area of the photo diode in each tested sample be 3.3 mm2. According to the above-described embodiment, the following effect can be obtain. First, in a light-receiving operation by the photo diode 4, it be surely prevent that the incoming light enters into the element arrange region 36 by the selectively provide light-shielding film 34. Thus, during the light-receiving operation by the photo diode 4, the signal processing be perform appropriately without cause error in the IIL element 5, the bipolar transistor 6 and any other circuit element, such as a diffusion resistor, a diode and a capacitor utilize a depletion-layer capacitance in the p-n junction. Furthermore, as the above-described arrangement incorporate the IIL element 5 serving as a digital circuit element integrally, it become possible to generate an accurate output signal as a digital signal which be generally robust against extraneous noise. Second, as the circuit incorporate the IIL element 5 serving as a digital circuit element, some of the manufacturing process for the IIL element 4 and the photo diode 4 can be commonly perform. This be advantageous in that the number of specially perform process can be substantially reduce. Third, as the thin-film resistor 27 be provide as a circuit element use for adjust the circuit performance, the output characteristic of each fabricate chip can be adjust easily by perform the laser trim processing. Fourth, as the light-shielding film 34 be form by an aluminum-group metallic film, it be not necessary to use a special member. A conventional wiring member, use in an ordinary IC manufacturing, can be use directly for form the light-shielding film 34. Fifth, the first TEOS film 31, the SOG layer 32 and the second TEOS film 33 be laminate as a united insulating film between the light-receiving film 34 and the substrate 1. This make it possible to remove many of unstable factor, such as variation in the film thickness and discontinuation of the surface level, when the light-shielding film 34 be form. Thus, the light-shielding ability can be assure in the element arrange region 36. Sixth, as the light-shielding film 34 be electrically connect to the substrate 1, no malfunction will be cause due to the parasitic capacitance form between the light-shielding film 34 and the aluminum wiring pattern 28. Seventh, as the substrate 1 have a surface azimuth define by( 100), the dark current can be reduce significantly compare with a substrate have a surface azimuth( 111). Even when the operating temperature be high, the detecting operation can be surely perform. The present invention be not limit to the above-described embodiment and can be modify in the following manner. Although the disclosed aluminum wiring pattern 28 be a single layer, it will be preferable to use a multilayered aluminum wiring pattern. The light-shield film 34 of AlSi can be replace by other appropriate aluminum-group metallic film, such as AlCu or pure aluminum. Similarly, the aluminum wiring pattern 28 can be form by use AlSi or AlCu. The IIL element 5, use as a digital circuit element, can be replace by other appropriate digital circuit element, such as TTL, CMOS, NMOS or PMOS. The bipolar transistor 6, use as an analog circuit element, can be replace by other appropriate analog circuit element, such as a diode, a resistance, a capacitor or a MOS transistor. The TEOS film, use as an insulating film for the flattening processing, can be replace by any other insulating film. Furthermore, the SOG 32 can be form by an appropriate member other than BPSG. The photo diode 4, disclose in the above-described embodiment, be position at the center of the chip, it be possible to change the position of the photo diode 4. Needless to say, the opening 34 a of the light-shielding film 34 be form at a portion correspond to the photo diode 4.
