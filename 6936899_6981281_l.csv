Description GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention wa made with Government support under Contract Number N66001-99C-8624 awarded by the Department of the Navy . The Government ha certain right in the invention . BACKGROUND Embodiments of the present invention relate to the generation of a pattern on a substrate using electron beam . A conventional electron beam pattern generator typically comprises an electron beam column in which a single electron beam is generated , modulated , and directed onto a substrate to expose an electron-sensitive resist material on the substrate . A substrate support is used to support and move the substrate . An electron beam source generates the electron beam . A beam modulator modulates the intensity of the electron beam . Beam optic are used to focus the electron beam . A beam scanner is used to scan the electron beam across the substrate . One problem with conventional pattern generator is that these system typically use a single beam and , consequently , generate a pattern at relatively slow speed because pixel are sequential exposed on the substrate in series . The exposure rate of single beam system is further limited by the total beam current . As the total beam current is increased , electron to electron interaction cause excessive proximity error by undesirably exposing region of the substrate that neighbor target region . Multiple electron beam pattern generator use a plurality of electron beam to generate an electron beam pattern on a substrate and , consequently , can generally operate with better resolution and at higher speed than single electron beam pattern generator . The multiple electron beam are accelerated to a high velocity at which they can be drawn from the electron source a separate and well-defined beam . However , the multiplicity and close spacing of the individual electron beam also result in distortion of the electron beam that limit the quality of the pattern formed on the substrate . For example , a the electron beam propagate towards the substrate , space charge interaction occur between the electron in neighboring electron beam , blurring and distorting the cross-sectional shape of the electron beam . As the total beam current is increased , electron to electron interaction limit beam resolution , and hence upper limit are placed on beam current and exposure rate to ensure adequate optical resolution and critical dimension control . Also , a the electron beam impinge on the substrate , the degree of exposure of a region on the substrate by one electron beam is undesirably affected by neighboring electron beam that simultaneously impinge on the substrate . Undesirable exposure can result from electron from individual beam scattering upon impact and also due to localized heating of the substrate from the energy of multiple beam . In addition , cross-over region where the multiple electron beam cross-over one another , such a during focusing of the beam , can result in beam to beam interaction that further reduce the resolution of the beam and increase beam error function . It is desirable to generate a pattern on a substrate using multiple electron beam having reduced beam interaction . It is further desirable to have a system capable of generating a pattern with multiple electron beam that exhibit reduced scattering or localized heating effect . It is also desirable to have a multiple electron beam pattern generating system capable of providing high exposure rate with good resolution .

DESCRIPTION Embodiments of a multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 are used to generate a pattern on a substrate 105 using multiple electron beam 110 , a illustrated in FIG . 1 . The illustrative apparatus provided herein should not be used to limit the scope of the invention , and the invention encompasses equivalent or alternative version , a would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art . The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 is suitable for generating a pattern on a substrate 105 that comprises one or more dielectric , semiconducting , or conducting material , including , for example , metal , polymer , or ceramic material , which are formed on the substrate 105 . The substrate 105 may comprise , for example , a blank mask comprising a transparent plate of glass or quartz , that is coated with an electron-sensitive resist layer 115 ( a shown ) and a metal layer ; a silicon wafer ; a compound semiconductor wafer ; a printed circuit board ( PCB ) ; or a multichip module ( MCM ) . The substrate 105 comprises an electron-sensitive resist layer 115 having a thickness of from about 20 nm to about 1 m , or even from about 50 to about 500 nm . For example , the resist layer 115 may be a multi-component resist layer having a top imaging layer with a thickness of from about 20 to about 150 nm . The pattern imprinted on the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 may be , for example , a latent image of a mask used in the fabrication of an integrated circuit ( IC ) , display , or printed circuit board ( PCB ) , or a circuit layout of an IC , display , or PCB . For the multi-component resist layer , the latent image can be transferred into lower layer , which themselves are used to further etch the pattern into the substrate 105 . For example , one of the lower layer may be a mask absorber , wafer , metal , or dielectric layer . After exposure of a mask to the electron beam 110 , the exposed resist layer 115 is developed to form the pattern on the mask . After generation of the pattern on the mask , IC , display , or PCB , the substrate material are etched to form feature such a a stencil mask , electrically interconnecting wiring or vias , or active or passive device , such a for example , resistor , capacitor , diode , and transistor . The feature may be shaped a , for example , line , plug , cavity , channel , hole and trench . In one version , the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 includes a laser beam section 120 coupled to an electron beam section 125 , a shown in FIG . 1 . The laser beam section 120 , a illustrated in FIG . 2 , includes a laser beam generator 130 , beam modulator 135 , and laser optic 140 . The laser beam generator 130 may be a deep ultraviolet ( DUV ) continuous-wave ( CW ) laser source in the wavelength range of from about 248 to about 266 nm . In one embodiment , the laser beam generator 130 is a 257 nm argon-ion laser source . In operation , a laser beam 144 is generated by the laser beam generator 130 and split into a plurality of individual laser beam 145 by a beam splitter 150 . The beam splitter 150 may comprise , for example , a diffractive optical element , such a a diffraction grating , or a group of one-way mirror . Typically , the multiple laser beam 145 form an array 155 , a shown . The array 155 of laser beam 145 enters the beam modulator 135 , where the intensity level of each of the laser beam 145 in the array 155 is individually modulated . For example , the beam modulator 135 may comprise an array of acousto-optic modulators ( AOMs ) , which switch the laser beam 145 on or off by acoustically diffracting the laser beam 145 in response to an RF signal , or set the transmitted photon flux of each individual beam to a predetermined intermediate value . In one embodiment , the laser beam 145 is split into an array 155 of 32 beam by the beam splitter 150 and an equivalent number of beam modulator element ( such a 32 AOMs ) are provided . In an AOM array , the modulation of the photon intensity is achieved by applying RF power to the individual AOM channel . Applying different level of RF power can be used for fine modulation of the laser intensity . In another embodiment , the beam modulator 135 comprises an array of spatial light modulators ( SLM ) that is adapted to modulate the intensity and spatial extent of the laser beam 145 . The SLM array can also serve a the beam splitter 150 or a part of the laser optic 140 . The spatial light modulator may comprise a micromechanical diffracting device , cantilevered beam , or deformable mirror array . The SLM array can be advantageous because it can typically modulate a larger number of laser beam 145 , such a from about 100 to about 10,000 laser beam 145 . A grayscale comprising multiple gray level and a multiple pas writing strategy may be used . Furthermore , an additional beam modulator ( not shown ) may be inserted in the optical system upstream of the splitter 150 to act a a fast auxiliary blanker . This additional beam modulator may be used during a scan retrace step for additional modulation . In one illustrative embodiment , a 300 MHz carrier frequency is used to diffract the laser beam 145 with an approximately 10 nsec pixel on-time . The individually modulated laser beam 145 , after passing through the beam modulator 135 , are demagnified by the laser optic 140 . The laser optic 140 may include optical light lens focused on a desired plane of the electron beam section 125 . The laser beam 145 from the laser beam generator 130 may also be actively controlled by automatic beam centering mirror 160 so that alignment to the optical train , both in position and angle , is maintained . An attenuator 165 , which may comprise a combination polarization rotating element and polarizing beam splitter , adjusts the laser power to a range suitable for operation of the system while allowing the laser beam generator 130 to operate in a power range optimized for reliability and stability . A spatial filter 170 can remove undesirable section of the laser beam 's intensity profile . Anamorphic relay optic may be provided to create a round beam from the laser light exiting this aperture and relay it to the beam splitter 150 comprising a diffractive optical element ( DOE ) 175 inside a brush module 180 . The DOE 175 in this exemplary embodiment is a grating that produce a plurality of laser beam 145 . For example , the DOE 175 may produce 32 laser beam 145 . The laser beam 145 are focused by the lens inside the brush module 180 to a region in the beam modulator 135 . A mechanical shutter 185 before the brush module 180 is used to block light from reaching the electron beam section 125 when the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 is not exposing the substrate 105 . A K-mirror 190 allows for rotational adjustment of the linear array of laser beam 145 exiting the additional beam modulator . A wave plate 195 aligns the polarization of the beam 145 for optimal focusing through a subsequent birefringent photocathode substrate that is described below . A lens element 200 after the wave plate 195 focus the laser beam array 155 onto an afocal spot on a steering mirror 205 . Before reaching the steering mirror 205 , any zero-order ( undiffracted ) light from the beam modulator 135 is blocked by a zero-order beam stop 210 . The steering mirror 205 allows for small positional adjustment of the spot array at the final image plane of an objective lens 215 . The zoom optic and stigmator 220 relay the focal spot into the pupil of the objective lens 215 . Tilted plate inside the zoom optic and stigmator 220 provide adjustment capability to ensure that the focus of the spot onto the electron beam section 125 occurs in the same plane whether measured along the direction of the array of spot or perpendicular to it . Movable lens within the zoom optic and stigmator 220 allow for slight magnification adjustment of the laser beam array 155 . Below the laser beam section 120 , the electron beam section 125 convert the laser beam image generated by the laser beam section 120 into a corresponding electron beam image . The electron beam section 125 may comprise a vacuum column 225 containing a vacuum environment in which electron beam 110 can be generated to expose the substrate 105 to the electron beam image . The vacuum column 225 comprises wall 230 that are substantially vacuum-tight and are typically made of a material such a aluminum . One or more vacuum pump ( not shown ) are provided to evacuate the vacuum column 225 to create and maintain the vacuum environment . In one embodiment , the vacuum pump provide a first vacuum environment at the top portion of the vacuum column 225 , and a second vacuum environment which may have a different vacuum pressure at the bottom portion of the vacuum column 225 . For example , the first vacuum environment may be at a gas pressure of about 109 Torr and the second vacuum environment may be at a gas pressure of about 106 Torr . A pressure barrier may also be provided between the vacuum environment to maintain the pressure difference . The electron beam section 125 includes a multiple electron beam source 235 , an anode 240 , and electron optic 245 . In one embodiment , the multiple electron beam source 235 , the anode 240 and a portion or all of the electron optic 245 form an electron gun whose element cooperate to extract , accelerate , and focus the electron beam 110 . In the operation of the illustrated version of FIG . 1 , the laser optic 140 focus the laser beam array 155 exiting the beam modulator 135 onto a photoemissive layer 250 of a photocathode 255 of the multiple electron beam source 235 . The photocathode 255 receives the laser beam image and generates the corresponding electron beam image out of the multiple electron beam 110 . The photocathode 255 may additionally comprise a substrate that is transparent to the laser beam 145 a they pas through the substrate to the photoemissive layer 250 . In operation , photon absorbed in the photocathode 255 excite electron above the energy level of the vacuum , and a portion of the electron that are sufficiently excited are emitted into the vacuum environment . In one embodiment , the photocathode 255 ha a photoyield of at least about 20 nA/mW . Examples of suitable photocathode 255 are CsBr ( cesium bromide ) photocathode , CsXTeY ( cesium telluride , where X and Y are rational number ) photocathode , CsMo photocathode , Mg ( magnesium ) photocathode , negative electron affinity photocathode , based for example on cesiated GaAs ( gallium arsenide ) , cesiated GaN ( gallium nitride ) photocathode , and silicon-cesium oxide nanoclusters and possibly gold with a covering of hydrocarbon . The cesium bromide and cesium telluride photocathode include a photoemissive layer of cesium bromide and cesium telluride , respectively . Cesium bromide and cesium telluride ( Cs2Te ) are compound semiconductor with bandgaps in the range of from about 3 to about 5 eV . For example , they can yield a high quantum efficiency ( about 10 % ) when irradiated with deep ultraviolet light having wavelength of from about 198 to about 365 nm , and produce electron having an energy spread of from about 1 to about 3 eV . In typical operation , a laser beam 145 in the wavelength range of from about 198 to about 365 nm can be used to illuminate the CsBr or Cs2Te photocathode . Certain embodiment may also include a cesium bromide ( CsBr ) layer applied to the top of a photocathode structure comprising oriented sapphire and a conducting Mo layer . For example , the CsBr layer may have a thickness of from about 5 to about 20 nm . Exemplary electron optic 245 are shown in greater detail in FIG . 3 . The photocathode 255 form an extraction field between itself and the anode 240 to draw electron beam 110 from the photocathode 255 and accelerate the electron beam 110 toward the substrate 105 . For example , the extraction field may have a strength of from about 5 to about 10 kV/mm . The electron are accelerated to an initial energy level to draw the electron from the multiple electron beam source 235 and form the electron into multiple defined electron beam 110 . The extraction energy level is selected to be sufficiently high to substantially prevent interaction between the electron beam 110 . When the electron beam 110 are moving vertically at a higher velocity , lateral interaction between the electron beam 110 are typically le significant than when the electron beam 110 are moving at lower velocity . In one embodiment , the electron beam 110 have varying individual width throughout the electron optic 245 with an ultimate resolution of from about 10 to about 100 nanometer . When a voltage is applied between the photocathode 255 and the anode 240 , the electron are accelerated and focused by the electron optic 245 to transfer the multiple laser beam image 166 at the photocathode 255 to a multiple electron beam image 111 at the substrate 105 . In one embodiment , the photocathode 255 is biased at about 50 kV , with respect to a grounded anode 240 that is separated from the photocathode 255 by an accelerating gap . The anode 240 is typically a planar metallic electrode with an aperture in the center . Alternatively to the photocathode version , the electron beam source 235 may comprise an array of controlled sized aperture illuminated by an electron gun to generate electron beam 110 . The electron gun may comprise , for example , a LaB6 or thermal field emission source to generate electron . One or more individually addressable electrode are provided about each of the aperture to draw the electron beam 110 from the electron gun and individually modulate the passage of each electron beam 110 . The aperture array may further comprise one or more extraction and focusing electrode adapted to extract electron beam 110 from the controlled aperture . The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises electron optic 245 to shape the electron beam 110 , such a to focus , demagnify , stigmate , or align the electron beam 110 . Optionally , an electron field lens 260 is used to reduce distortion and aberration a the multiple electron beam image is transferred to demagnification lens 275 that follow . Further detail of exemplary electron optic are shown in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat . No . 6,215,128 by Mankos et al. , titled A Compact Photoemission Source , Field and Objective Lens Arrangement for High Throughput Electron Beam Lithography , filed on Mar . 18 , 1999 , which is hereby incorporated by reference in it entirety . The field lens 260 collimates the electron exiting the accelerating region above the anode 240 and converges the electron beam 110 to at least one crossover , such a in the plane of a beam-limiting aperture 270 . As shown , the field lens 260 generates a magnetic field , but it can alternatively comprise an electrostatic lens assembly to generate an electric field . The image created by the field lens 260 is then subsequently demagnified by the demagnification and objective magnetic lens 275 , 280 to form an array 285 of focused electron beam 110 . A set of alignment and stigmation coil 290 is used to center and stigmate the electron beam array 285 in the beam-limiting aperture 270 and in the objective lens 280 . In one embodiment , a beam scanner 295 comprising a set of magnetic beam deflection coil 297 is used to scan the array 285 of individually modulated electron beam 110 across the substrate 105 . Another set of magnetic deflection coil 300 performs dynamic stigmation and focus a the electron beam array 285 is scanned across a field of the substrate 105 . This allows dynamic stigmation , focus , or x/y deflection correction to be applied to different part of the scan field . The electron beam path traversed by the electron beam 110 can be curvilinear . The orientation of the laser beam section 120 to the electron beam section 125 may be adapted to convenience , for example such that the configuration is suitable to the overall exterior packaging of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 . In one embodiment , the component of the electron beam section 215 , such a the multiple electron beam source 235 , anode 240 , and beam scanner 295 , are coaxially aligned in a column above the substrate 105 The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises a substrate support 305 capable of supporting the substrate 105 . The support 305 may comprise an electrostatic chuck ( not shown ) capable of holding the substrate 105 against the support 305 , or alternatively a gravity-held kinematic mount ( not shown ) . The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may also comprise support motor capable of moving the support 305 to precisely position the substrate 105 in relation to the electron optic 245 or to move the substrate 105 to translate the electron beam 110 across the substrate 105 . For example , the support motor may comprise electric motor that transport the support 305 in the x and y direction along an x-y plane parallel to the substrate surface , rotate the support 305 , elevate or lower the support 305 , or tilt the support 305 . The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may further comprise support position sensor capable of precisely determining the position of the support 305 . For example , the support position sensor may operate in conjunction with a substrate height sensor , which reflects a light beam from the substrate 105 and detects the intensity of the reflected beam to precisely determine the actual distance between the substrate 105 and a focal plane of the electron beam 110 . In one embodiment , the focal plane of the electron beam 110 is by a vertical position of a fiducial mark locator 340 . As the array 285 of electron beam 110 approach the substrate 105 , the electron beam 110 are retarded by a beam retarding system 310 that applies retarding electric potential about the electron beam 110 to decrease the kinetic energy of the electron beam 110 substantially near the substrate 105 . The retarding electrical potential is an electrical potential that is lower than the electric potential maintained at a component , such a the anode 240 , that precedes the location of application of the retarding potential along the path traversed by the electron beam 110 . The retarding electrical potential decrease the kinetic energy of the electron beam 110 to a level that is sufficiently low that the electron are in a range of desirable landing energy at the time they strike the electron-sensitive resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 . The correspondingly lower landing velocity of the electron beam 110 provide better exposure efficiency since lower beam current can be used while maintaining desirably high resolution level . The resolution of the exposure pattern formed in the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 may be similar to conventional higher energy exposure because aberration due to the retarding process scale down with the decreased final beam energy , and because the electron that are at a much lower energy level tend to travel shorter distance both through the thickness of the resist layer 115 and sideways into adjacent pixel region . Also , the lower electron beam current expose the resist layer 115 more efficiently because the electron with lower kinetic energy have a larger effective cross-section within the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 . Higher energy electron tend to penetrate deeper into the resist layer 115 and are delivered in larger dos due to their smaller effective cross-section . Additionally , the lower electron current decrease the amount of space charge interaction between the electron beam 110 to improve the resolution of the electron beam 110 and the quality of pattern generation . Typically , the electron beam 110 are decelerated from their peak kinetic energy , which occurs after acceleration beyond the anode 240 . In one embodiment , it is desirable to retard the electron beam 110 to a landing energy of from about 100 eV to about 5 keV . Furthermore , for a multi-component resist layer having a top imaging layer with a thickness of from about 20 to about 150 nm , the proximity effect due to sideways exposure into adjacent pixel region are reduced . In one version , a shown in FIG . 3 , the electron beam retarding system 310 comprises a potential decreasing element 315 held at a lower electric potential than the anode 240 , such a a negative potential relative to the potential of the anode , and is located between the anode 240 and the substrate support 305 , about or inside the substrate support 305 , or below the substrate support 305 . The potential decreasing element 315 creates a region of low electric potential above the substrate support 305 such that the electron beam 110 are decelerated . For example , if the multiple electron beam source 235 , anode 240 , and potential decreasing element 315 are adapted to be at electric potential VB , VA , and VB+VL , respectively , then VL may be from about 0.1 to about 5 kV . In one embodiment , the anode 240 is grounded and VA is approximately zero . Alternatively or in addition to the range of VL provided above , the ratio of VB to VL may preferably be from about 10 to about 100 . In one embodiment , VL is from about 0.5 kV to about 3 kV . By retarding the electron beam 110 , beam-to-beam interaction , scattering , and localized heating effect can be reduced while improving one or both of exposure rate and resolution . The electron beam retarding system 310 act upon electron emerging from objective magnetic lens 275 , 280 of the column 225 , the electron having a high beam energy EB , such a in the range of from about 10 to about 100 keV , but impinging on the substrate 105 with a retarded landing energy EL , such a from about 0.1 to about 5 keV . For example , the potential decreasing element 315 may be a retarding electrode 320 near the substrate support 305 . The retarding electrode 320 may comprise a laterally extended conductor having an aperture 325 therein to allow passage of the electron beam 110 through the aperture 325 . The aperture 325 in the retarding electrode 320 may have a diameter of from about 10 to about 1000 time the full-width-half-maximum ( FWHM ) diameter of the electron beam 110 to suitably allow passage of the electron beam 110 therethrough while also effectively retarding the electron beam 110 . In one version , the substrate support 305 is adapted to apply a retarding potential to the substrate 105 via a potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305 . For example , the substrate support 305 may comprise a retarding electrode 330 that connects to a retarding voltage supply 335 and make electrical contact with the substrate 105 to maintain the substrate 105 at a desirable electric potential . In one embodiment , the retarding electrode 330 is a conductive pin that pass through a portion of the substrate support 305 and contact the underside or topside of the substrate 105 . The substrate support 305 can be adapted so that the retarding electrode 330 and the substrate 105 are electrically isolated . For example , if the vacuum column 225 is grounded , the substrate 105 should be electrically floated from the vacuum column 225 to ensure that the substrate 105 is held at the appropriate retarding potential by the retarding voltage supply 335 . This potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305 may be used by itself or in combination with the potential decreasing element 315 between the anode 240 and the substrate support 305 , about the substrate support 305 , or below the substrate support 305 . When a plurality of potential decreasing element 315 are used , the retarding potential may be applied in stage . For example , a first potential decreasing element 320 above the substrate support 305 may be maintained at a first retarding voltage Vr1 , and a second potential decreasing element 330 in the substrate support 305 may be at a second retarding voltage Vr2 that is lower than the first retarding voltage Vr1 , a shown in FIG . 3 . This generates two successive potential drop region that allow the retarding potential to be more gradually stepped , thereby lessening deleterious electric field effect that may be caused by a large potential difference between two adjacent conductor . Vr1 can be further subdivided if the first potential decreasing element 320 comprises a plurality of electrode , such a an electrostatic Einzel lens , which may"

In one exemplary em ... 4 6936982 5 6936983 6 6936984 Name : wku , dtype : object illustrated by the plot of FIG . 4 the electron beam 110 are accelerated in the vacuum column 225 to an energy of about 50 keV before being retarded . In this example the multiple electron beam source 235 is held at a potential of about 50 kV other optional optical component below the multiple electron beam source 235 may be at potential higher than 50 kV and one optical component farther down such a the anode 240 may be at a potential of about 0 V. A retarding potential is applied to the potential decreasing element 315 to decelerate the electron beam 110 from an energy of about 50 keV to an energy of about 1 keV . For example the substrate support 305 may be held at a potential of about 49 kV by the potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305 such that the electron beam 110 decelerates to 1 keV a it approach the substrate 105 . Exposure rate refers to the area of the pattern exposed on the substrate 105 per unit time and determines the speed of pattern generation . A first factor affecting exposure rate is the total beam current used to pattern the substrate 105 . The total beam current is equal to the number of electron beam Nb multiplied by the current Ib delivered by each electron beam 110 . The exposure rate R ( cm2/sec ) of a system is typically equal to the total beam current I ( Amps ) divided by the resist sensitivity S ( C/cm2 ) . Thus the time Tto expose a given area is approximately AS/NbIb where A is the area to be patterned . High exposure rate can be achieved by using a sufficiently large number of electron beam 110 and a sufficiently large current in each electron beam 110 . However the retarded electron beam 110 described above can expose more area in a given amount of time since the resist sensitivity S is approximately proportional to the energy of the electron beam 110 . Therefore the total beam current can be decreased while maintaining exposure rate the advantage being improved resolution . Or alternatively exposure rate can be increased while maintaining total beam current at a given resolution . The improved performance allows the use of confined brush optic having one or more crossover . This substantially increase the operating range of the optic and extends the system performance . Another benefit of the retarding potential configuration is that due to the low landing energy EL proximity effect from electron scattering are eliminated or greatly reduced . The reduced landing energy also reduces the incident exposure power which in turn reduces deleterious heating effect within the substrate 105 . A multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 that us a plurality of electron beam 110 to generate a pattern on a substrate 105 can consequently operate with better resolution with better dimensional control and at higher exposure rate than single electron beam pattern generator . First the total current I=NbIb is divided into a plurality of beam 110 Nb . The spatial separation of the beam 110 help reduce the space charge interaction within the optic a well a heating effect on the substrate 105 . Both factor improve print resolution . The extended spatial extent of the beam 110 also can allow a lower substrate support velocity a the effective field of view is increased a well a reduce the slew rate of the electronics used to scan the beam array 155 . There are other system benefit to using multiple electron beam optic having a single deflection system . The confined brush of the multiple electron beam array can be driven by a raster bitmapped datapath having the capability of handling large pattern file a input to the system . The use of a confined brush array can simplify the calibration of their position and dosage . This multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 can thereby exceed the resolution of conventional pattern generator . Further benefit of the confined brush configuration include maintaining efficient calibration a the number of beam 110 is increased substrate support yaw pitch and roll error that have an impact on pattern positional accuracy can be greatly reduced compared to extended exposure strategy that have highly separated distance between individual beam 110 . The total beam current can be reduced by one or two order of magnitude such a a reduction of about 50 time in comparison to a conventional electron beam pattern generator that doe not retard the electron beam 110 while maintaining a good exposure throughput . Space charge interaction between the electron beam 110 are reduced because of these significantly lower beam current . This improvement may even yield higher throughput than certain conventional pattern generator such a throughput of for example at least about 1 wafer per hour for wafer having a diameter of about 300 mm . Moreover a lower power laser beam generator 130 can be used to generate the lower current electron beam 110 . Pixel delivery data rate and optical field of view are other system factor that can be taken into account to meet desired exposure rate . Multiple electron beam patterning permit the use of slower data clock since the pixel exposure rate is the product of the number of electron beam 110 and the data clock rate . The extended field of the electron beam 110 effectively increase the field of view and thereby reduces the corresponding substrate support velocity for a given exposure rate . In one embodiment the potential decreasing element 315 and retarding voltage supply 335 are provided in a beam retarding modification kit for a conventional electron beam pattern generator . For example the retarding electrode 320 can be installed in a conventional electron beam pattern generator to add the capability of retarding multiple electron beam 110 . Additionally or alternatively the substrate support can be modified to include the potential decreasing element 315 or the conventional substrate support can be replaced with an upgraded substrate support 305 that includes the potential decreasing element 315 . For example a retarding electrode 330 provided in the beam retarding modification kit may be embedded in the conventional substrate support and connected to the retarding voltage supply 335 to upgrade the substrate support . Additionally the substrate support can be modified to electrically isolate the substrate 105 from other part of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 such a the vacuum column 225 . The beam retarding modification kit provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative to replacement of the entire conventional electron beam pattern generator with an improved multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 having the multiple beam retarding capability described herein . Returning to FIG . 1 the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may further comprise a fiducial mark locator 340 capable of locating fiducial mark ( not shown ) on the substrate 105 . The fiducial mark may be used a reference point of the substrate 105 . For example the fiducial mark of the substrate 105 may be useful for preemptively correcting the pattern to be generated on the substrate 105 . Fiducial mark may move relative to their intended location during processing of the substrate 105 . The degree of movement or misalignment of the fiducial mark may vary at different region of the substrate 105 depending upon the localized stress or distortion of the substrate 105 or the apparatus that placed the fiducial mark . The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises a controller 400 comprising a suitable configuration of hardware and software to operate the component of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 to generate a pattern on the substrate 105 . An exemplary controller 400 is illustrated in FIG . 1 . For example the controller 400 may comprise a central processing unit ( CPU ) 405 that is connected to a memory 410 and other component . The CPU 405 comprises a microprocessor such a a complex instruction set computer ( CISC ) microprocessor for example a Pentium ( ) microprocessor commercially available from Intel Corporation Santa Clara Calif. or a reduced instruction set computer ( RISC ) microprocessor capable of executing a computer-readable program 415 . The memory 410 may comprise a computer-readable medium such a hard disk 420 in a redundant array of independent disk ( RAID ) configuration removable storage 425 such a an optical compact disc ( CD ) or floppy disk random access memory ( RAM ) 430 and/or other type of volatile or non-volatile memory . The interface between a human operator and the controller 400 can be for example via a display 435 such a a flat panel display or cathode ray tube ( CRT ) monitor and an input device such a a keyboard 440 . The controller 400 may also include drive electronics 445 such a analog and digital input/output board linear motor driver board or stepper motor controller board . The computer-readable program 415 a shown in FIG . 5 generally comprises software comprising set of instruction to operate the apparatus component and an apparatus manager 450 to manage the instruction set . The computer-readable program 415 can be written in any conventional programming language such a for example assembly language C C++ or Pascal . Suitable program code is entered into a single file or multiple file using a conventional text editor and stored or embodied in the memory 410 of the controller 400 . If the entered code text is in a high level language the code is compiled and the resultant compiler code is then linked with an object code of pre-compiled library routine . To execute the linked compiled object code the user invokes the feature code causing the CPU 405 to read and execute the code to perform the task identified in the computer-readable program 415 . Using a keyboard interface a human user enters command or registration parameter into the computer-readable program 415 in response to menu or screen displayed on the display 435 . The computer-readable program 415 may include instruction set to for example control the positioning of the substrate support 305 ( instruction set 455 ) locate the fiducial mark ( instruction set 460 ) control beam modulation ( instruction set 465 ) control data compression ( instruction set 470 ) and control the retarding of the electron beam 110 ( instruction set 473 ) . The instruction set may receive parameter such a a data file corresponding to the support position the fiducial mark location the pattern or instruction entered by the human operator . The controller 400 is adapted to generate send and receive signal to operate the apparatus component to generate a pattern on the substrate 105 using electron beam 110 . For example the controller 400 may send signal to the beam modulator 135 to control modulation of the electron beam 110 to the desired intensity level and in correspondence to the electron beam pattern data . The beam modulator 135 may also be controlled to scale the pattern in the scanning direction by timing the beam pulse and the support motor may also receive real-time instruction from the controller 400 to control the position of the substrate 105 to scale rotate or offset the pattern generated by the electron beam 110 on the substrate 105 . As another example the controller 400 may also operate the fiducial mark locator 340 by receiving measured location of the fiducial mark and comparing them to their intended location to determine the deviation of each fiducial mark . The controller 400 may control the beam modulator 135 and beam scanner 295 of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 to scan the electron beam 110 across the substrate 105 according to a raster method or alternatively according to a vector method . Depending on the scanning method used the pattern data that are stored in the memory 410 and communicated to the beam modulator 135 are also different . FIG . 6 is a block diagram showing a data processing path for a raster scanned electron pattern . In a raster method the pattern data 475 are processed into a bitmap 480 by a rasterizer 485 and the bitmap 480 is stored in the memory 410 . An exemplary rasterizer 485 is described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat . No . 5 533.0 170 by Teitzel et al . titled Rasterizer for a Pattern Generation Apparatus filed on Nov. 22 1994.0 which is hereby incorporated by reference in it entirety . Thereafter a corrector 490 corrects the bitmap to compensate for proximity exposure effect by making change in dosage . A sequencer 495 then sequence the bitmap to sequentially apply the bitmap data to the modulation of the individual electron beam 110 . Control of pixel dosage is determined by the modulation of the electron beam 110 a a function of time . The electron beam 110 are scanned across the substrate 105 in coordination with the translation of the substrate support 305 and in a substantially predetermined sequence of parallel scan line to generate the pattern on the substrate 105 . In a vector scanning method in contrast the pattern data are stored a vector . For example data corresponding to a line can be stored a a vector comprising a starting position a length and a direction . Additionally certain other shape may be stored in a way that refers to the characteristic dimension of the shape . The electron beam 110 are scanned across the substrate 105 along path that correspond to the pattern vector . For example to draw a line the beam scanner 295 could deflect an electron beam 110 to the starting position in a first step the beam modulator 135 turn on the electron beam 110 in a second step the beam scanner 295 deflects the turned-on electron beam 110 through the length of the line in a third step and the beam modulator 135 turn off the electron beam 110 in a fourth step . The electron beam 110 are spatially distributed such that interference and other crosstalk between them are reduced or eliminated . However a final exposed pattern in the resist layer 115 produced by raster scanning is typically composed of overlapping spot which can be accomplished by employing an interlaced scan pattern print strategy and writing with multiple pass . FIGS . 7 and 8 illustrate an embodiment of such an interlaced raster scanning method . Shown in FIG . 7 is a portion of the leading edge of an electron beam brush 500 . More particularly the first five ( 5 ) beam 110 of the brush 500 are shown for clarity . The electron beam brush 500 is scanned in the direction perpendicular to the alignment of the brush 500 . By the next scan the substrate support 305 ha moved in the direction of the alignment of the electron beam 110 in the brush 500 . In FIG . 8 are shown a plurality of offset brush line 510 and a single continuous line 520 resulting from the interlacing of the offset brush line 510 . The offset brush line 510 fill in the continuous line in the y direction while forming line in the x direction . The controller 400 may contain pattern data in the memory 410 in either flat or hierarchical format . The flat format contain the pattern information in a raw form that is not organized by hierarchy or otherwise compressed . For example the flat format may comprise MEBES mode 3 4.0 or 5 . In contrast the hierarchical format contain the pattern information in a compressed hierarchical organization that expedites storage transmission from the memory 410 to the beam modulator 135 . For example the hierarchical format may comprise GDS II ( a trademark of Calma Corporation Santa Clara Calif. ) . Although the present invention ha been described in considerable detail with regard to certain preferred version thereof other version are possible . The present invention could be used with other multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 or other equivalent configuration a would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art . For example the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may generate a pattern on a substrate 105 using electron beam 110 that are generated and modulated directly by an electron source and that doe not use the laser beam section 120 . Thus the appended claim should not be limited to the description of the preferred version contained herein . ''"

Description This application claim the priority of German Document No . 102 51 763 , filed Nov. 7 , 2002 , the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein . BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a device for actuating a plurality of electric motor in a transportation device , which ha a plurality of output stage and a control circuit for actuating these output stage . Each output stage is connected to an electric motor for providing a current for activating the electric motor . The number of electronic component in the transportation device , in particular in motor vehicle , is continuously increasing . The increasing amount of power electronics in each electric motor respectively entail a proportional increase in the cost of the electronics . Because of the high density of electronics within contemporary transportation device , in particular the retrofitting of electric motor must also be taken into account . Control circuit and power electronics have to be retrofittable for this situation if the mean of transportation is to be retrofitted during it long service life . In addition , electric motor in a motor vehicle are often switched on only for a short time and in many case this precludes the simultaneous operation of another electric motor in parallel . As a result , the multiple arrangement of expensive output stage within one motor vehicle is a waste of existing electronic resource . A wide variety of solution are already used in motor vehicle for actuating electric motor . Such device relate to mean of transportation such a aircraft , waterborne vessel or motor vehicle . These device have the following design : a control circuit with a microcomputer or a logic circuit evaluates input data and signal from operator control element and us sensor signal to calculate the regulating variable and control variable for the mean of transportation . For the actual actuation of the electric motor , output stage are used which connect through or disconnect the power current for the electric motor . Today , such output stage have power breaker in the form of transistor , thyristors or diacs . These power breaker are activated by the control circuit in accordance with the calculated control variable and regulating variable so that the current for the electric motor is connected through or disconnected according to requirement . If the current for the electric motor is connected through , they begin to rotate so that , for example , a seat is actuated and can be moved . In the case of semiconductor switch , a matrix-like arrangement of semiconductor is known which have various semiconductor switch . European Patent EP 240805 A2 discloses a power breaking matrix such a is used in computer technology or in telecommunication . However , there is no consideration here of the generic use for actuating electric motor in mean of transportation . German Patent DE 697 05 002 T2 discloses a matrix-like actuation circuit for a plurality of lamp , in each case one output stage is connected to a row line and a column line . As a result , a plurality of lamp can be actuated with relatively few output stage . The actuation circuit is le suitable for actuating electric motor a they can be operated only in one direction if a motor vehicle battery is used for supplying power . German Patent DE 199 10 194 C2 discloses a measuring circuit for a pressure-sensitive resistance matrix using operation measuring amplifier which are connected to the resistor matrix . However , the circuit is not suitable for actuating electric motor . The object of the present invention is to reduce the number of output stage in order to operate a predefined number of electric motor in both direction of rotation . In addition , when an output stage fails , it is to be possible to actuate the respective electric motor by a further alternative output stage . This object is achieved according to the invention by using a plurality of output stage additionally connected to , in each case , one further electric motor by the control circuit . The control circuit actuates each output stage in such a way that the output stage can actuate either the first or the further electric motor with the output stage being interconnected to one another and/or to the electric motor in the manner of a matrix so that there are a plurality of row line and a plurality of column line , at whose point of intersection the electric motor are arranged . Using each row line and each column line , in each case two output stage are connected to power breaker which connect , in accordance with the signal of the control circuit , to a first or a second potential , in particular earth and Ubatt . As a result the actuated electric motor can be operated either in one direction or the other . The output stage each have at least one power breaker and control the power current in order to actuate electric motor in a mean of transportation . Such output stage constitute a high cost factor within the mean of transportation and it is then possible , within the scope of the teaching according to the invention , to make a saving by eliminating them because the electric motor which are arranged within a matrix can be actuated in each case by an output stage by mean of the row line and column line . For example , two to nine electric motor can be connected to an output stage at one row line and this output stage can alternatively actuate a plurality of electric motor . Owing to the lower number of output stage , the expenditure on cooling and the installation space for the output stage within the power electronics is reduced . The power semiconductor are utilized effectively , in particular if , of the electric motor arranged in the matrix , in each case only one electric motor can be operated . Moreover , by virtue of the matrix-like arrangement and the possibility of actuating further electric motor in the matrix , the system can also be enlarged by mean of further electric motor after the mean of transportation ha been delivered . For this purpose , all that is needed for the control circuit is new software which permit the output stage to actuate the additional electric motor . The inventive arrangement of the electric motor within the matrix and the arrangement of the output stage at the end of the row line or column line permit the number of output stage to be reduced in comparison with the electric motor to be actuated . Owing to the centralization of the electric motor in matrix form it is possible to construct both the electric motor and the output stage in modular form , i.e . provide them with similar interface so that they can be replaced by a further module . Owing to the centralization , the control circuit can be equipped with a more complex power management system for the electric motor a they can then be arranged within one control circuit for all the electric motor . Moreover , the matrix-like structure permit the electric motor and the output stage to be supplied by mean of film line , specifically on the one hand by mean of high-current film line for supplying the electric motor with power and on the other hand by mean of low-current film line for the logic actuation of the output stage by the control circuit . The matrix-like and modular design also make it easier for failed component to be retrofitted here a all that is necessary is to replace one module in the matrix , and at the same time the interface can be respectively standardized . According to the invention , the device is constructed in such a way that in each case two output stage , which connect to a first or a second potential in accordance with the signal of the control circuit , are connected to each row line and each column line . The first potential may be the zero potential , corresponding to the negative pole of the battery in the mean of transportation , while the second potential can be the positive battery voltage , for example 12 to 14 volt . If an electric motor of the matrix is then arranged between the first column line of the first row line , the electric motor is driven , for example , in the clockwise direction if the first row line conduct zero potential and the first column line conduct the positive battery potential , while the electric motor is driven in the anticlockwise direction if the first row line conduct the positive battery potential and the first column line conduct the zero potential . Two output stage , one which connects to the zero potential and one which connects to the positive battery potential , are arranged on the first column line . Thus the respective output stage can be actuated in order to make available the corresponding potential for the electric motor . As two output stage are also arranged on the first column line , one output stage can be actuated by the control circuit to connect through to a positive battery potential . If then , for example , the first row line is connected to zero potential , a further electric motor of the matrix can then be actuated in parallel with the first electric motor if the second column line also connects through the corresponding positive potential . For this purpose , the control circuit actuates the corresponding output stage of the second column line so that the latter connects through the supply current for the second electric motor . By virtue of the redundant arrangement of the two output stage per row line or column line it is possible for each of the line to be connected alternatively to two potential , respectively permitting the right-handed or left-handed operation of an electric motor . The object of the present invention is , however , also achieved by a device where the electric motor are each arranged between two power supply line with a plurality of electric motor being connected in each case to a common power supply line , and the respective other power supply connection of these electric motor being connected to different power supply line . Each power supply line is electrically connected to , in each case , two output stage , the first output stage being connected to a first potential , and the second output stage being connected to a second potential . A circuit breaker is provided between a plurality of electric motor and in each case the assigned power supply circuit in order to prevent parallel current a a result of electric motor which are not actuated . The device according to the invention reduces the number of output stage for operating the electric motor . The modularization result in improved retrofittability and higher flexibility together with lower cost . Owing to the centralization of the technology , the reliability of the component and of the entire system is improved and , in addition to the reduced expenditure on component and monitoring , it is possible to exchange and replace the individual element more easily . The device according to the invention provides for the power-electronic output stage to be interconnected to the actuated electric motor by mean of a matrix-like structure . The electric motor are arranged here between a first and a second power supply line , which are also referred to a column line or row line . The column line and row line are laid within the mean of transportation and in technical practice not laid linearly and at right angle to one another . The concept of column line or row line indicate however the actuation pattern of a plurality of electric motor through the various column line and row line . The electric motor are distributed between a predefined number of row line m and a certain number of column line n in such a way that in each case one power supply line is connected to a connection of the electric motor , while the other power supply line is connected to the other connection of the electric motor . For the sake of easy comprehension of the device it is possible to say that the electric motor are connected to the point of intersection between the column line and the row line . In addition , electric motor can also be arranged between two column line or between two row line , in which case the column line which lie next to one another must however always be connected to different potential so that the electric motor can be operated . For example , when the first electric motor is operating , the first column line is then at zero potential while the second column line is at positive battery potential . A combination is also possible so that individual electric motor are arranged at the point of intersection between column line and row line and other electric motor are connected between in each case , two column line or , in each case , two row line . The number of power supply line between the electric motor is reduced a a result of the matrix-like connection of the electric motor . On each supply line , a plurality of electric motor are connected using the power supply connection provided for that purpose . The control circuit is connected to the output stage using , for example , film flat line or conventional line in order to provide the actuation current for the output stage . The control circuit may have a microcontroller in which the control algorithm are stored in order to be able to operate them in accordance with the requirement in the mean of transportation . This microcontroller may also contain the complete control function of a control device . As already described , a circuit breaker which help to avoid parallel current across the connection matrix is provided within the matrix . The circuit breaker permit an electric motor to be supplied with power by adding the power supply line if the voltage drop across the electric motor , which is caused by the difference in potential between the two power supply line of the electric motor , is greater than a threshold voltage . The power breaker of the circuit breaker can switch off the flow of current in both direction . This power breaker is intended to prevent the formation of parasitic parallel mass current across the further electric motor which are arranged within the matrix and not actuated . The circuit breaker prevents the flow of current if there is a series circuit composed of a plurality of electric motor at one row line or one column line . The circuit breaker must operate bidirectionally so that motor current can permit or disable the left-handed or right-handed rotation of an electric motor . One possible way of implementing the circuit breaker is what is referred to a an electronic diac . The circuit is composed of two power semiconductor switch which are each connected to the connection of the electric motor and whose other end is connected to the column line or row line . Two Schottky diode which are connected in antiparallel generate a slight drop in voltage across the power breaker if the latter is connected to the on position . Two Zener diode which are connected in parallel in crisscross fashion set the breakdown voltage to , for example , 6 to 9 volt so that when this breakdown voltage is exceeded the power semiconductor is switched on in order to feed the supply current to the actuated electric motor . If the breakdown voltage at the Zener diode drop below the necessary threshold voltage when an electric motor is not actuated , the circuit breaker switch off and the electric motor is no longer supplied with the corresponding power current . This ensures that only the electric motor which are actuated directly by the control circuit draw current , while the electric motor in parallel branch of the matrix-like electric motor system remain switched off if the actuation voltage , i.e . the difference in potential between the column line and row line is lower than the breakdown voltage . This electronic diac can expediently be applied to circuit board and film line or integrated directly into the electric motor . Owing to the matrix-like structure within the device , an error routine can be initiated if the individual power component fail . For this purpose , it is possible to provide , at those output stage which connect to the lower voltage level , a measuring shunt which ha the purpose of measuring current . This measured value can be used to monitor the current of the electric motor and can serve a an overload protection for the power breaker . The registration of the measurement signal and the processing of the corresponding evaluation routine which are necessary for this purpose can then be carried out by mean of the control circuit which , in the case of an excess current , switch off the respective electric motor and actuates the electric motor via an alternative output stage . In each case two of the output stage may be combined to form what is referred to a a MOSFET half bridge , each of which half bridge are connected to the end of a power supply line . The MOSFET half bridge ha , for this purpose , two MOSFET semiconductor power breaker which can be connected through by the control circuit via a corresponding actuation circuit . In order to operate a specific electric motor , the column line and row line which are connected to this electric motor must be connected to the potential corresponding to the direction of rotation . In this context , one power breaker of the MOSFET half bridge connects to the zero potential , while the other semiconductor switch of the MOSFET half bridge connects to the positive battery potential . The device according to the invention provides for a matrix-like connection of the electric motor which can each be switched on by a control circuit . The electric motor are operated , for example , by mean of the MOSFET half bridge in accordance with the control specification of the control circuit . The control circuit monitor the power flux within the matrix and performs corresponding error routine if component fail . The circuit breaker in the form of the electronic diac prevents parasitic series connection within the matrix-like interconnection of the electric motor and automatically disconnect non-actuated electric motor from the supply voltage . The device according to the invention ha considerable advantage over conventional actuation circuit within a mean of transportation . A number of electric motor , predefined by the requirement made of the mean of transportation , may be arranged in modular fashion within the described circuit topology and actuated by mean of a relatively small number of output stage . 15 electric motor can be actuated by , for example , 6 MOSFET half bridge , which , without the provided switching matrix , would require approximately 30 half bridge with the same function . However , the matrix-like arrangement also permit the number of control output of the control circuit to be reduced , a a result of which the number of susceptible contact is also reduced . The reduced number of power component also reduces the expenditure on cooling . The installation volume and the weight of the control circuit is reduced . This is apparent in particular in the field of motor vehicle seat where today up to 30 electric motor are used . The reduced expenditure on component permit the reliability of the control device to be increased . The electric motor can also be embodied a a stepping electric motor and have a plurality of connection for power supply line . In each case earth potential or a predefined positive potential is applied to these connection . For this purpose , the motor is connected in an electrically conductive fashion to a plurality of column line and the output stage can then connect through the voltage in accordance with the control circuit in each case . The stepping motor can be provided , for example , in vehicle seat for setting the sitting position . There are various possible way of advantageously configuring and developing the teaching of the present invention . In this respect , reference is made , on the one hand , to the subordinate claim and , on the other , to the following explanation of an embodiment . One embodiment of the device according to the invention is illustrated in the drawing in which , in each case in a schematic representation , Other object , advantage and novel feature of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG . 1 show a circuit diagram of the device according to the invention with electric motor which are arranged in the manner of a matrix and the associated output stage , FIG . 2 is a representation of the technical embodiment with two electric motor and their cabling by mean of ribbon conductor according to the present invention , FIG . 3 show a basic representation of the electric power profile and of the profile of a parasitic parallel current given a matrix-like arrangement of electric motor according to the present invention , and FIG . 4 show a circuit diagram of a circuit breaker for avoiding parallel current according to the present invention . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The device for actuating a plurality of electric motor 1 in a mean of transportation ha a plurality of output stage 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , the output stage 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 each connecting through the current for activating the electric motor 1 . The electric motor 1 are interconnected according to the invention in the manner of a matrix , three electric motor 1 being connected to the row line 6 . Three electric motor 1 are likewise connected to the column line 7 . The electric motor 1 are interconnected to one another in the manner of a matrix by mean of the row and column line 6 and 7 . In each case two output stage 2 , 3 are connected in electrically conductive fashion to , in each case , one end of the row line 6 . The output stage 2 connects the row line 6 in each case to earth , while the output stage 3 connects the row line 6 to the positive battery potential Ubatt . Likewise , the output stage 4 connects the column line 7 to earth , while the output stage 5 connects the column line 7 to the positive battery potential Ubatt . At the point of intersection 8 , a first electric motor 1 is connected between the row line 6 and a column line 7 . If , for example , the column line 7 is connected to 0 volt by the output stage 4 , and approximately 12 volt battery voltage Ubatt are applied to the row line 6 via the output stage 3 , the electric motor 1 is operated in accordance with it intended function . If the output stage 3 switch off so that the circuit is disconnected , the electric motor 1 is also switched off . By actuating the output stage 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 differently it is possible to switch on and off each electric motor 1 located in the matrix . Owing to the matrix-like arrangement , a smaller number of output stage 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 is necessary in total in comparison with the individual actuation of the electric motor 1 . In addition to the arrangement of the electric motor 1 at point of intersection 8 , it is also possible to arrange an electric motor 9 between a plurality of column line 7 . The electric motor 9 is switched on if one column line 7 is at zero potential and the other column line is at positive battery potential Ubatt . FIG . 2 illustrates part of the device with two electric motor 1 which are connected to power supply line 10 , each with an output stage circuit board 13 and 14 , respectively . In each case two half bridge 11 and 12 are arranged on each of the output stage circuit board 13 , 14 , two output stage being integrated in each half bridge 11 , 12 . The output stage circuit board 13 is connected correspondingly to the individual conductor of the ribbon cable 15 , and the output stage circuit board 14 is connected to other conductor of the ribbon cable 15 so that a matrix-like interconnection of the electric motor 1 is produced . FIG . 3 illustrates the current profile 16 when the electric motor 1 is actuated . To do this , the output stage 3 is connected through so that the potential Ubatt is connected to the row line 6 , the current at the point of intersection 8 flowing through the electric motor 1 to the column line 7 which is connected via the output stage 4 to the earth potential of the battery of the vehicle . Although all the other output stage are switched off in this exemplary embodiment , a parasitic parallel current 17 may be formed , which flow via the row line 6 and the parallel electric motor 1 to the column line 18 and from there via the parallel electric motor 1 to the row line 19 where the current finally flow back to the column line 7 via the electric motor 1 , and from said column line 7 to the zero potential . This parasitic parallel current 17 is an undesired power loss which is prevented by the circuit breaker 20 illustrated in FIG . 4 . The circuit breaker 20 which is illustrated in FIG . 4 can be arranged at each electric motor 1 in order to avoid parasitic parallel current 17 . The circuit breaker 20 isolates the electric motor 1 from the supply line 6 , 7 when the electric motor 1 is not actuated by the output stage 2 , 3 or 4 , 5 . However , if the electric motor 1 is actuated by the output stage 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 with an actuation voltage of , for example , 12 volt via the row line 6 and column line 7 , the actuation voltage exceeds the breakdown threshold voltage of the Zener diode 21 , which may be at approximately 6 volt , a a result of which the power breaker 22 is connected through so that the current I can flow through the Schottky diode 23 and the power breaker 22 . If the actuation voltage through the output stage 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 is switched off , the Zener diode 21 begin to switch off again , a a result of which the power breaker 22 and the Schottky diode 24 , which is connected with opposite polarity , switch off . If the electric motor 1 is operated in the opposite direction in the form of an electric motor , the column line 7 is connected to higher potential , and the row line 6 is connected to zero potential . The breakdown voltage of the Zener diode 25 is exceeded again so that the power semiconductor 26 connects through . The current can then flow in the opposite direction to the first current I through the Schottky diode 24 and the power breaker 26 and in doing so operate the electric motor 1 in the opposite direction . The Schottky diode 23 and 24 have the positive effect that a particularly low drop in voltage is generated if a high supply current flow through the electric motor 1 . The resistor 27 are provided for setting the switching behavior of the circuit breaker 20 . The circuit breaker 20 according to the invention is configured in such a way that the assigned electric motor 1 is isolated from the supply current if it is not actuated directly via the output stage 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 . As a result , parasitic parallel current 17 are prevented . The foregoing disclosure ha been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting . Since modification of the disclosed embodiment incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to person skilled in the art , the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claim and equivalent thereof ."

Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 . Field of the Invention The invention relates to a motor vehicle door lock with an electromechanical central locking system drive . 2 . Description of Related Art A conventional motor vehicle door lock of the type under consideration , therefore the lock for a motor vehicle side door , a rear hatch or a rear door , but also for a sliding door of a motor vehicle , generally ha locking element , such a a latch and ratchet , and a lock mechanism with various lever which are used for actuation . In particular , reference can be made to the prior art ( for example , published German Patent Application DE 100 06 765 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat . No . 5,673,578 ) . Motor vehicle door lock with an electromechanical central locking system drive ( for example , German Patent Application DE 100 06 765 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat . No . 5,673,578 ) are common . It generally drive a mechanical central locking system element of the lock mechanism in order to move the motor vehicle door lock , overall , at least into a unlocked position , in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the inside and outside , and into a locked position in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the inside , but can not be opened from the outside . Often , a third position is also set up , specifically an antitheft position , in which the motor vehicle door can not be opened either from the outside or from the inside . Finally , on the rear side door and on the rear door , there can also be a child safety position in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the outside , but not from the inside . The detail in this respect are not important to the teaching of this invention , which relates to the control of the electromechanical central locking system drive . The known motor vehicle door lock underlying the invention ( German Patent Application DE 33 39 479 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat . No . 5,673,578 ) , first of all , ha an electromechanical central locking system drive and a mechanical central locking system element driven by it , in the form of a central locking system drive lever . In this prior art , the central locking system drive encompasses an electric drive motor , a linkage with a gearwheel which form the driven element , and driver journal which is located on the gearwheel and via which the central locking system element which is made a a pivot lever can be pivoted back and forth between two position , the unlocked position and the locked position . The construction here is such that the central locking system element with the electric drive motor switched off is decoupled from the drive motor and can be mechanically moved free of resistance from one position into another , for example by actuating a closing cylinder . This motor vehicle door lock ha an electronic motor control . The latter encompasses a motor state sensor in the form of a motor current sensor which measure the current drawn by the electric drive motor . The motor control is designed such that it directly trigger or automatically trigger the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locking position either after receiving an actuation signal from an actuation unit such a a closing cylinder , a locking button , a remote control receiving unit or a handle ( inside door handle , outside door handle ) , a soon a a certain operating state of the motor vehicle ha been reached . The latter , of course , requires an actuation signal , which is not initiated by an operator , but it is automatically initiated when a certain operating state of the motor vehicle is reached . Such an operating state is , for example , a certain minimum speed of the motor vehicle after being parked beforehand . This function of the known motor vehicle door lock is used to protect passenger against hold-ups at traffic light or the like . When the operator ha climbed into the vehicle , ha started the engine and ha set off , all door lock of the motor vehicle are automatically locked when a minimum speed of the motor vehicle is exceeded and they remain locked until the operator climb out again . In the known motor vehicle door lock explained above , the motor control can do something else , for example it can turn off the electric drive motor when the locked position ( or the unlocked position ) is reached . Here it is provided specifically that to turn off the electric drive motor there is at least one stop which block further rotation of the electric drive motor . The motor control is designed such that the electric drive motor is turned off at least when the locked position is reached according to the signal of the motor state sensor . In the motor current sensor which is known in the prior art , this mean that the power consumption of the electric drive motor is monitored and the electric drive motor is turned off when a certain boundary value of the motor current is exceeded beyond a certain time . This is evaluated in the motor control a blocking of the motor by the central locking system element or the stop , then the electric drive motor is turned off . This is called blocking operation of the electric drive motor . This make it possible to abandon microswitches which sense certain position of the electric drive motor of the step-down gearing , generally downstream of it and/or of the mechanical central locking system element . This save money and reduces fault susceptibility of the motor vehicle door lock . In practice , it ha been shown that in motor vehicle door lock with electromechanical central locking system drive with automatic locking a a result of reaching a defined operating state of the motor vehicle , the noise of the central locking system drive when being turned off is perceived a disturbing . This applies when the turning-off take place by mean of microswitches because the lock mechanism is also stopped suddenly in this case . This applies to a special degree in blocking operation of the electric drive motor because a mechanical element strike a stop in some form and is thus stopped . Very similar disturbing noise occurs when the electric drive motor , after receiving an actuation signal from the actuation unit , is to a certain extent deliberately stopped by the operator . However , in this case , this noise is perceived a le disturbing because the operator is more or le prepared for it . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to improve the motor vehicle door lock explained in detail above with respect to noise formation . The aforementioned object is achieved by a motor vehicle door lock with a central locking system drive having an electric drive motor and a motor control with a motor state sensor , and a central locking system element that can be moved by the central locking system drive at least into a locked position and the motor control being designed such that it trigger the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locked position after receiving an actuation signal from an actuation unit , such a a closing cylinder , a locking button , a remote control receiving unit or a handle ( inside door handle , outside door handle ) , by the motor control having a control circuit which includes the motor state sensor and that is designed such that , when the electric drive motor is triggered , the electric drive motor run with low rpm and is controlled using the signal of the motor state sensor to these rpm . The motor control which is present anyway is used in accordance with the invention to control the rpm of the electric drive motor . Thus , it is possible to have the electric drive motor , a a whole , run much more slowly than previously conventional . A more slowly running electric drive motor doe lead to slower reaction of the mechanism of the motor vehicle door lock , but enjoys a series of major advantage . First , there is optimum rpm matching over the entire path of motion of the central locking system element . Unnecessarily high acceleration force are avoided on the lever of the lock mechanism . The slow running speed of the central locking system drive lead to a reduction of noise formation . The blocking operation of the electric drive motor can be easily integrated into the control circuit , and the blocking current can be additionally limited . In particular , in a digital control circuit this function can be accomplished essentially without additional cost , simply in the programming of a microcomputer . A standard central locking system drive in a conventional motor vehicle is designed for the usual vehicle voltage , in Europe generally 12 V , but it must also work properly with a lower voltage , for example , 9 V at 85 C. , but of course also with an overvoltage , for example , 16 V. Proper operation is defined a the counterforces which engage a lever apparatus moved by the central locking system drive a far a the inside safety button having to be overcome . In other word , this mean that , in the normal case , the central locking system drive inherently work too quickly and powerfully and especially travel into the block . The central locking system drive according to the invention is moved with a much lower voltage , for example , a voltage of 3 V. With this lower voltage , the central locking system drive , of course , doe not have the torque necessary for overcoming additional counterforces . The control of the rpm of the electric drive motor provided in accordance with the invention now lead to the power supply voltage increasing in reaction to the load and when the load is removed , it is reduced again . Overall , the central locking system drive thus run more slowly and le powerfully , but for this reason much more quietly . The teaching of the invention is of special importance for automatic triggering of the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locked position a soon a a certain operating state of the motor vehicle ha been reached , the control circuit being designed such that after reaching a certain operating state of the motor vehicle , the electric drive motor run at an rpm which is much lower a compared to the normal triggering of the electric drive motor after receiving an actuating signal , and is controlled to these lower rpm using the signal of the motor state sensor . It is particularly useful when the certain operating state is a certain driving speed being reached after initial starting or restarting of the motor vehicle . In this case , the slower reaction of the mechanism is not perceived a disturbing because , with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor , the operator doe not perceive the passage of time anyway . That is , the operator perceives positively only that the motor vehicle door lock is working very quietly because the rpm is so low and therefore the inevitable impact noise is reduced to a minimum . The above described control can always be activated . However , occasionally this can be a disadvantage because the slower reaction of the mechanism is perceived a disturbing . In this case , it can be provided that this control is only activated when the motor control automatically trigger the electric drive motor . When the electric drive motor is triggered after receiving an actuation signal , it remains in this case in the classical , relatively noisy functioning of the motor vehicle door lock . This is perceived quite positively by the operator because he acquires an acoustic report with respect to the function of the motor vehicle door lock . The control which ha been described above for automatic actuation of the electric drive motor can also be selectively actuated when the electric drive motor is manually triggered from the interior of the motor vehicle , for example , with the locking button for general locking of the motor vehicle or with a locking button or the like for triggering the child safety . Within the motor vehicle , specifically also for manual triggering , the noise development of the motor vehicle door lock is perceived a stronger than from the outside . Accordingly , it is perceived a comfortable and pleasant even if , in this case , the operation of the central locking system drive is quiet . For the invention described here , the use of a motor current sensor is recommended a the motor state sensor of the motor vehicle door lock , because such a motor current sensor for a direct current motor which is used conventionally in a motor vehicle constitutes an economical sensor element . Fundamentally , other sensor can also be used , for example , an rpm sensor ( rotary transducer , pulse counter ; magnetic or optical sensor ) . A torque sensor ( especially a mechanical-electrical sensor such a a strain gauge ) would also be suitable solely for the shutoff function of the motor vehicle door lock . Overall , circuit which are known from the prior art for these purpose , especially analog control circuit or digital control circuit , are suited for the configuration of the motor control in itself . For this purpose , reference should be made to the technical literature in this regard ( see , for example , Tietze , Schenck Semiconductor Circuitry , 10th edition , Springer , Berlin , 1993 , especially Chapter 18 Power Supply , especially 18.3 Linear Voltage Regulators , and Chapter 27 Electronic Controllers ) . Embodiments are explained in the special part of the specification ( description of the figure ) . The invention is explained in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawing which show a preferred embodiment . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the drawing , the sole FIGURE show the operating principle of the invention in the manner of an operating diagram . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Some explanation to which reference should be made here can be found in the Background part of the specification pertaining to the basic structure of a motor vehicle door lock with a central locking system drive , to which the teaching of this invention relates . The teaching of the invention relates to a motor vehicle door lock with an electromechanical central locking system drive 1 and a mechanical central locking system element 2 which is driven by it . In the embodiment shown in the FIGURE , the central locking system drive 1 ha an electric drive motor 3 which drive the mechanical central locking system element 2 , which is made here a a pivot lever , via a step-down gear , which is made here a toothed gearing 4 . There are a host of other structure for electric drive motor 3 with step-down gearing 4 , for example , a worm gear pair , spur/bevel wheel gear , and partially coupled to it , spindle/spindle nut gear . Reference should be made to the prior art in this regard , which provides a host of alternative here . Furthermore , an important prerequisite for the invention is that the central locking system drive 1 ha a motor control 5 . The motor control 5 in the FIGURE is connected to the DC voltage of the vehicle electrical network VN a represented at the power supply terminal 7 on the left , and also control the turning on and off of the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 , according to the invention . Part of the motor control is a motor state sensor 6 . It is made , in this example , a a motor current sensor , specifically a a sensor resistor . The central locking system element 2 can be moved at least in the locked position shown in the FIGURE by the central locking system drive 1 ; in this embodiment , by a gear wheel 4 a of the step-down gearing 4 . Basically , it is possible to have the central locking system drive 1 operate in one direction and even operate such that only the locked position is ever started by the central locking system drive 1 . The unlocked position could then be only mechanically started . Normally , it is such that the central locking system drive 1 move the central locking system element 2 not only into the locked position , but also in the unlocked position , in any case , for motor vehicle door lock which are not activated directly by a handle . This embodiment show such a reversibly operating central locking system drive 1 . Finally , there are central locking system drive which can actuate three position , specifically , the unlocked position , the locked position , and the antitheft position , likewise also a child safety position . However , it is only of importance for the invention that the central locking system drive 1 can actuate at least the locked position . The motor control 5 is designed such that it trigger the electric drive motor 3 for driving the central locking system element 2 into the locked position after receiving an actuating signal from an actuation unit , such a a closing cylinder , a locking button , a remote control receiving unit ( outside door handle , inside door handle ) . Furthermore , the motor control 5 is designed such that it also automatically trigger the electric drive motor 3 a soon a a certain operating state of the motor vehicle ha been reached . A certain operating state can be defined , for example , a the state in which airbag sensor have established individual in all place in the vehicle . In particular , reaching a certain driving speed after one-time or repeated starting of the motor vehicle is defined a one such certain operating state . This is a function which modern motor vehicle door lock increasingly have for reason of safety , protection from hold-ups at traffic light or the like . Often nowadays , a motor control 5 is implemented in an integrated circuit , especially a microcomputer , so that the design of the motor control 5 mean essentially it suitable programming . The FIGURE show that the motor control 5 ha a control circuit including the motor state sensor 6 and this control circuit is designed such that when the electric drive motor 3 is triggered , the electric drive motor 3 run with a low rpm and is controlled using the signal of the motor state sensor 6 to this rpm . In particular , reference should be made here to the above described explanation of the preferred construction and the control circuit in the Summary of the Invention portion of this application . It is especially preferable , and in this embodiment it is also implemented , that the control circuit is designed such that , with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor 3 after reaching a certain operating state of the motor vehicle , especially a certain driving speed of the motor vehicle , the electric drive motor 3 run at an rpm which that is significantly reduced a compared to the normal triggering of the electric drive motor 3 after receiving an actuating signal , and that the motor is controlled to these lower rpm using the signal of the motor state sensor . The motor control 5 show the microcomputer 8 which centrally organizes all control function of the motor control 5 . On the input side , on the one hand , a speed sensor 9 for determining the respective vehicle speed , on the other hand , at least one actuating sensor 10 for detecting an actuation signal by the actuating unit a explained above , here shown a a radio remote control 10 a , are connected to the microcomputer 8 . The microcomputer 8 , therefore , on the one hand , receives an input signal which allows the microcomputer 8 to ascertain that a certain operating state of the motor vehicle ha been reached , in this embodiment that a certain driving speed of the vehicle ha been reached , and on the other hand , an actuation signal which indicates active actuation by an operator . In this connection , it should also be pointed out that reducing the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 of the central locking system drive 1 can also be practical or can be perceived a pleasant with manual triggering from the interior of the motor vehicle , for example , when the inside locking button or the actuating mean for the child safety on the rear side door is actuated . This ha already been addressed above . Furthermore , the microcomputer 8 ha a measurement input 11 , which is connected to the motor state sensor 6 , here the motor current sensor ( resistor ) . The output of the microcomputer 8 are connected to two motor changeover switch 12 which make it possible to drive the electric drive motor 3 in two direction of rotation . By reversing the polarity of the terminal 13 of the electric drive motor 3 by mean of the motor changeover switch 12 , one direction of rotation or the other can be stipulated , or when the motor changeover switch 12 are connected opposite one another , a short circuit of the terminal 13 for purpose of high-speed braking of the electric drive motor 3 can be induced . If there is one electric drive motor 3 with only one direction of rotation , these motor changeover switch are of course not required , and a normal on/off switch can be used . It go without saying that the motor changeover switch 12 will preferably be electronic switch ( for example , transistor or thyristor switch ) , a can also be integrated into the overall circuit arrangement of the microcomputer 8 or on a corresponding board . Basically of course , electromechanical switch can not be connected . The use of the control circuit of the motor control 5 , here , by mean of the microcomputer 8 , make it possible to control the electric drive motor 3 with automatic triggering , for example , a a result of the signal of the speed sensor 9 , to an rpm which is minimum with respect to the instantaneous operating state . In this embodiment , the microcomputer 8 is programmed such that this take place basically only with automatic triggering , although it would also be fundamentally possible quite generally to operate the electric drive motor 3 accordingly rpm-controlled . Basically , it would be possible to directly detect the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 , for example , by mean of a rpm sensor on the driven shaft of the electric drive motor 3 . These sensor are known from the prior art a rotary transducer , pulse counter , etc . In particular , optoelectronic rpm sensor are also available . In any case , this embodiment show a motor current sensor a a motor state sensor 6 , an especially economical and reliable approach . In the operating state described here , the central locking system drive 1 will be run with minimum rpm from the starting point to the end stop of the locked position , shown in the FIGURE . Rpm change of the electric drive motor 3 which occur during this motion , due to fluctuation of the torque which is to be applied by the electric drive motor 3 , are equalized by the microcomputer 8 by controlling the power supply voltage of the electric drive motor 3 . If the torque on the driven shaft of the electric drive motor 3 increase , the current drawn by the electric drive motor 3 increase . The voltage drop on the internal resistor of the electric drive motor 3 increase , the induced voltage drop and the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 drop back . Accordingly , the reaction is the reverse when the torque which is to be applied by the electric drive motor 3 is reduced . The circuit shown in the FIGURE ascertains , via the motor state sensor 6 in the form of a measurement resistor , the voltage drop which is proportional to the motor current and which is evaluated by the microcomputer 8 . If the voltage drop increase , the microcomputer accordingly raise the power supply voltage of the electric drive motor 3 until the desired rpm of the electric drive motor 6 ha been reached again . In this way , the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 can be reduced to near the minimum possible rpm which , of course , should always be reached , so that the electric drive motor 3 in the meantime doe not stop suddenly and hang up . This result in the displacement of the central locking system element 2 with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor 3 taking place a slowly a possible . In this way , the noise development of the central locking system drive 3 with the central locking system element 2 is minimized . The operator who is sitting in the vehicle doe not acoustically notice after the vehicle is started that the motor vehicle door lock are closing with the electromechanical central locking system . At least the operator sitting in the vehicle perceives the closing of the electromechanical central locking system a especially quiet . The corresponding also applies when locking take place manually from the inside . Likewise , this also applies to unlocking from inside the vehicle . Overall control can be exercised such that only actuation by the operator from the outside initiate the normal , acoustically intensive operating mode of the central locking system , but automatic triggering and triggering by actuation of the interior always result in the controlled operating mode of the central locking system . In the normal case , therefore , for actuation by the operator and when the actuation signal is received by the actuating sensor 10 , the microcomputer 8 can trigger the electric drive motor 3 with a higher rpm so that the noise development is greater . For the operator this mean the desired acoustic report that his actuation ha been successful . This embodiment of the motor control 5 can also be used especially favorably when there is at least one stop 14 which block additional rotation of the electric drive motor 3 to turn off the electric drive motor 3 . Here then , specifically , the motor control 5 can be designed such that the electric drive motor 3 is turned off at least when the locked position is reached according to the signal of the motor state sensor 6 . Thus , without further cost , blocking operation of the central locking system drive 1 can be integrated by circuitry . In this embodiment , the stop 14 is itself specified by a stop surface on the central locking system element 2 , against which a journal on the gear wheel 4 a of the step-down gear 4 move , a is shown in the FIGURE . This is a technology which is known from DE 44 39 479 A1 , and corresponding U.S. Pat . No . 5,673,578 or also U.S. Pat . No . 4,793,640 A . Examples of control circuit can be found in the technical literature , for example , in the Tietze , Schenck citation which is mentioned in the Background part of the specification ."

Description CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claim the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser . No . 60/228,530 filed Aug. 28 , 2000 . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 . Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a position detection and anti-pinch system for a power window of a vehicle and more particularly to a position detection and anti-pinch system and method for detecting the position of a window in a vehicle door assembly . 2 . Background Art Door assembly for automotive vehicle generally include a metal door frame attached to the body of a vehicle . The door frame generally includes inner and outer door frame panel joined about a common edge and a door sill running along top edge of the door to define a window frame . The window frame includes an opening or channel extending through the door frame to receive a window pane . A reinforcement panel may be attached to the inner door panel to provide additional structural support for the door frame and to receive various hardware component . Hardware component such a a handle assembly , window regulator and motor assembly , and electrical component such a interior light and speaker , are secured to the reinforcement panel concurrently with assembly of the vehicle door . Certain vehicle door assembly include automatic vehicle window adjustment having a one-touch up feature . The one-touch up feature allows a passenger to raise the window pane with a single touch of a control button on the vehicle door . When actuated , the switch activates a motor assembly operatively connected to a window regulator , causing the window regulator to move the window pane upward toward the top of the window frame to a fully closed position without additional operator intervention . Of particular concern with such one-touch system is that the passenger may not be able to stop the upward travel of the window pane if an object or an appendage of a person becomes pinched or trapped between the moving window and the window frame , which may lead to significant bodily harm . Several type of obstruction detection system have been proposed for vehicle door assembly . One known obstruction detection system includes a control module which sens current spike in the window drive motor or pressure on the window which would indicate an obstruction being pinched between the upward moving window and the window frame . The obstruction detection system stop and/or revers the motor upon sensing the current spike or increased pressure while raising the motor . The problem with this design is that an object must be trapped or pinched with sufficient force for the system to sense the need to reverse the motor and lower the window , causing undesirable injury to an occupant prior to the lowering of the window . Further , the sensor is mounted adjacent the motor rather than the window pane , which doe not provide an accurate measurement if an object becomes trapped between the window and window pane . Another known obstruction detection or anti-pinch system includes a window seal with a gasket having varying resistivity based upon it level of compression . For example , if an obstruction is pinched between the window and the window frame , the gasket is locally compressed , which alters the resistivity of the gasket . A low current is applied through the gasket , and the variation in resistivity may be sensed to determine the existence of the obstruction , at which point upward movement of the window would be stopped . The system is not particularly desirable because the resistive gasket and associated electronics may be costly and injury may still occur prior to the lowering of the window . Generally , it is known in window control design to determine the velocity of a power window via pulse from the rotation of a motor 's shaft . These pulse are generated by Hall sensor ( magnetic sensing ) , CPD ( commutator pulse detection ) or switch that provide an open or closed circuit a the motor spin . To coordinate a system to detect information about a moving power windowpane , a supplier must change the system that they are designing to accept these pulse . Control algorithm must then be used to determine the velocity and position of the windowpane based on the received the pulse information . This task is especially critical when considering safety standard like FMVSS 118 , where an obstacle must be detected during an auto-up function before a predetermined force is exerted on the window a a result of an obstruction in the path of the power window . With such stringent guideline , the control system in such motor pulse generating arrangement must learn the characteristic of not only the motor , but the regulator , grease and all of the mechanical linkage between the motor and the window . The system must also be able to accommodate temperature variation and different road condition into the control process . All of these factor must be considered to provide flawless auto-up operation . Accordingly , it is desirable to provide an improved window position detection and anti-pinch system for an automatic power window of a vehicle . It is also desirable to provide a window position detection system incorporating an anti-pinch detection system which prevents an obstruction from becoming trapped or lodged between a window and a window frame of the vehicle door . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the above-referenced shortcoming of prior art obstruction detection system by providing a window position detection and anti-pinch system and method for detecting the presence of an obstruction between a window and window frame of a door assembly of a vehicle . The system includes at least one sensing device disposed adjacent the window for detecting the position of the window relative to the window frame . The at least one sensing device monitor the position of the window and generates an output representative of the detected position of the window relative to the window frame A controller is in communication with and is responsive to the output generated by the at least one sensing device . The controller compare the window position output signal generated by the at least one sensing device against predetermined value to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window and window frame . The controller will generate a control signal to stop and reverse the travel of the window upon detection of an obstruction between the window and window frame .

A seal extends through the inner periphery of a cavity in window frame 28 to receive the upper edge 30 , 32 of window pane 26 . The seal , which is preferably formed of rubber or other polymeric material , ensures a waterproof and soundproof seal for the interior passenger compartment of the vehicle by sealing the upper edge 30 , 32 of window pane 26 and the inner periphery 34 of window frame 28 respectively . Referring now to FIGS . 2 and 3 , a first embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system of the present invention is discussed in greater detail .

This process can be performed , for example , a part of the vehicle assembly process . After the initial learning phase is completed , the controller 44 of system 36 will utilize the learned boundary a a reference base for position sensing of the window 26 . The boundary would only need to be reset if the physical part of the system somehow become misaligned . Such a process advantageously provides a manufacturing plant a simple process of applying the coding to the window that is independent of the car manufacturer . In other word , the system can be put on any platform without concern of window or motor supplier a long a the initial learning process occurs .

Sensing device 42 is preferably mounted in the inner periphery of the vehicle door frame 12 between inner and outer door panel 14 , 16 adjacent the passage 22 in the bottom edge of window frame 28 and an outer edge of window 26 . In operation , a the window pane 26 move upward in door assembly 10 , sensor of sensing device 42 measure and receives high and low input signal corresponding to the digital coding 40 on window pane 26 . Coding 40 is binary and is disposed a known distance apart . The transmitter of sensing device 42 generates signal interrupt or output based on sensor measurement representative of the window position relative to the window frame and transmits the measured signal to controller 44 . Controller 44 is responsive to the output signal generated by the sensing device 42 , to determine the vertical position of the window pane 26 relative to the window frame 28 . Alternatively , controller 44 may compare output signal generated by sensing device 42 against predetermined value to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window and window frame . It is also understood that other sensor output arrangement may be employed with sensing device 42 and controller 44 of system 36 . Window position detection system 36 additionally operates a an anti-pinch system for vehicle door assembly 10 . This feature is especially helpful when incorporated into a system having a one-touch-up type operation , i.e. , a system that allows a window to be closed or opened by a single actuation of a button or switch . Window position detection system 36 includes a self checking option incorporated in controller 44 . Coding 40 provides static position detection measurement to controller 44 . Controller 44 monitor the output signal generated by sensing device 42 to detect vertical position of the window 26 relative to window frame 28 . The controller 44 additionally compare the window position against predetermined value to detect the presence of an obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28 . Since controller 44 know what value to expect next during the upward or downward travel of window pane 26 , the controller 44 can detect a system error when the expected value is not received , or not received within a particular time period corresponding to the expected velocity of the window 26 . If such a condition is detected , controller 44 can generate an alert signal to warn the occupant of the vehicle to check the window 26 in door assembly 10 . The self-checking feature of controller 44 can be used to stop automatic operation of the window 26 if an error is detected . In operation , coding arrangement 40 of system 36 , in addition to sensing static window position , allows controller 44 to detect the presence of obstruction between to upper edge 30 , 32 of window pane 26 and window frame 28 . The microprocessor/controller 44 detects any change in the velocity of travel of the window pane 26 in the door assembly 10 to determine the presence of an obstruction . Since the system can determine the position and velocity of the window 26 , system 36 can sense the presence of an obstacle in the window path by detecting a decrease in velocity at a certain window position . If such a condition is detected , the controller 44 can initiate a control sequence , transmitting a signal to motor 38 to stop and/or reverse the travel of the window 26 in window frame 28 . Referring now to FIGS . 4-6 , a second embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system of vehicle door assembly 10 of the present invention is disclosed . The second embodiment of window position detection system , generally referenced by numeral 56 , provides an anti-pinch arrangement for detecting obstacle during the upward travel of a window pane 26 during a one-touch-up operation . System 56 includes two redundant detection method to determine whether or not an obstacle is in the way of a moving power window 26 . A transmitter 58 is recessed into a top rear portion of the door frame 12 below header section 18 to a monitor the opening 22 of window frame 28 . Transmitter 58 sends a energy signal 60 , such a directed infrared light , or an ultrasound wave , along inner periphery 34 of the window frame adjacent the upper portion of window frame 28 . Transmitter 58 is designed to emit ac signal that is laser thin so a to be unnoticeable to the operator and that is coded and sufficiently filtered to attenuate sunlight or other ambient light . The signal 60 generated by transmitter 58 follows the linear outline of the window frame 28 bent via a prism 62 at a change in angle of the door frame 12 . Prism 62 is positioned in the path of signal 60 and is arranged to redirect signal 60 along the edge of window frame 28 adjacent door sill 20 toward a receiver 64 . Receiver 64 is adapted to detect any variation in the transmission of electromagnetic energy signal 60 from the transmitter 58 . Alternatively , fiber optic could be used to send and receive infrared light , and communicate with the controller 44 . As is shown in FIG . 6 , prism 62 may additionally include a shutter 66 arranged to block the energy signal 60 entering prism 62 if an obstruction contact a lower end of shutter 66 . If an obstacle intrudes into the area of interest near the bottom of the prism 62 , spring 68 will compress , forcing the prism 62 upward in the housing 67 over the prism lens 70 , thereby breaking the energy signal 60 between the transmitter 58 and receiver 64 . The transmitter 58 , prism 62 and receiver 64 monitor a distinct area of the passage 22 in window frame 28 between the upper edge 30 , 32 of window 26 and the inner surface of window frame 28 . Controller 44 is in communication with the transmitter 58 and receiver 64 by wire 72 to generate and process the signal detected . Controller 44 terminates the upward travel of the window pane 26 by generating a signal to stop and/or reverse motor 38 if an obstruction is detected between the window pane 26 and window frame 28 which break the continuity of the transmission . It is understood that transmitter 58 , prism 62 and receiver 64 can be used with a variety of geometry of window frame 28 provided in vehicle door assembly . The second , redundant detection method is provided via a coding 74 on the window 26 . In a preferred embodiment , coding 74 is provided on the window adjacent a portion extending within the window frame 28 of door assembly 10 such that the coding is unnoticeable to the passenger of the vehicle . Coding 74 allows the controller 44 through sensing device 76 , 78 , to monitor the velocity and position of the window 26 during the upward travel of the window relative to window frame 28 of door assembly 10 . As best seen in FIG . 5 , the coding 74 is measured via an infrared reflection arrangement 76 , an infrared transmission arrangement 78 , such a a suitable transmitter 80 and receiver 82 arranged to pas an infrared signal through the coding 74 , or a capacitive or magnetic reading arrangement . The coding 74 is preferably equally spaced and arranged to be a known distance apart in a binary format . Monitoring arrangement 76 , 78 detected coding 74 and generate output signal representative of the detected position of the window 26 . Controller 44 monitor output from arrangement 76 , 78 through wire 77 , 79 to track the position of the window 26 based on the coding 74 . With a known window mass , the controller 44 can be programmed to determine the force applied against the window by an obstruction based on predetermined value . If the window is not in a parked ( all the way up or down ) state and the force exceeds a predetermined limit , the controller 44 change the direction of travel of the window 26 by instructing the motor 38 to stop and/or reverse the movement of the window . Referring now to FIGS . 7-10 , alternative embodiment of the window position detection system for a vehicle door assembly of the present invention are disclosed . A window position detection and anti-pinch system 84 is provided on a vehicle door assembly 10 adjacent window pane 26 . As is shown schematically in FIG . 7 , system 84 us a sensing arrangement 88 , such a a rotary encoder , that monitor the position and velocity of the window a the window 26 travel through door assembly 10 . Unlike prior art measuring system which were mounted on or adjacent the motor 38 to measure change in velocity at the motor , sensing arrangement 88 divorce itself from the motor altogether with the intention of providing clean pulse to a central processing unit or controller 90 . Mounting sensing arrangement 88 adjacent window 26 provides a greater correlation between the measured value at the window to window velocity , force and position relative to the window frame 28 . The window position detection system 84 includes an encoder 92 positioned adjacent to window and attached to a rotary member 94 , such a a pulley or roller , via a shaft 96 . The rotary member 94 is pressed against the window 26 . In operation , the upward and downward travel of the window 26 in door assembly 10 rotates member 94 . The rotational movement of member 94 is translated to the encoder 92 via shaft 96 . The encoder can be arranged to provide a predetermined number of pulse per distance of movement of the window . The high resolution of this sensor , which can be tailored to the need of the control system 84 , provides a robust source of data for the controller 90 . Further , because the data is directly based on actual window movement , rather than the velocity or the power output of the motor , the data provides a better correlation for determining the relative position of the window in operation or the presence of an obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28 . As is shown in FIGS . 8 ( a ) - ( b ) , a third embodiment of the of present invention is shown providing a window position and velocity detection system 84 having a resistive or voltage sensing rotary encoding arrangement 88 in lieu of a pulse generating circuit from the motor . In this embodiment , the window 26 itself is used a the basis for determining the window 's position and velocity . With this arrangement , system reliability is improved while also providing independence of the window control system design from the design of the motor and window manufacture . In accordance with this embodiment , a plurality of electrical contact 98 are provided about the outer periphery 100 of rotary encoder 92 . At least one corresponding electrical contact 102 is provided adjacent to and in engagement with electrical contact 98 on rotary encoder 92 . The at least one electrical contact 102 monitor pulse generated by the rotation of the electrical contact 98 on rotary encoder 92 by the travel of the window 26 relative to window frame 28 . Controller 90 , responsive to the output from encoder 92 and in communication with the at least one electrical contact 102 through wire 104 , electrically sens open and closed circuit connection between contact 98 and 100 to determine the relative position , velocity and force of the window a well a the presence of any obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28 . FIGS . 9 ( a ) - ( b ) show another embodiment of the window position detection system 84 of the present invention . In this embodiment , a multi-poled magnet 106 is centrally disposed on the rotary encoder 92 and aligned with the rotational axis 108 extending through shaft 96 . A Hall effect sensor 108 is disposed radially outwardly of magnet 106 on an outer edge 112 of the rotary encoder 92 . Sensor 108 communicates with controller 90 through wire 114 to provide pulse measurement of position and velocity by magnetically sensing the revolution of the multi-poled magnet 106 via the Hall effect sensor 108 . Referring now to FIGS . 10 ( a ) - ( b ) , a fifth embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system 84 of the present invention is disclosed . In this embodiment , rotary encoder 92 includes intermittent hole 116 positioned therein which allow a energy signal , such a an infrared light beam , to pas through . A photointerrupter 118 is positioned adjacent to and about the outer periphery of the rotary encoder 92 . Photointerrupter 118 generates pulse in response to interruption of the infrared beam a the encoder rotates in response to the travel of the window 26 in door assembly 10 . Photointerrupter 118 transmits these pulse to controller 90 through wire 120 . Controller 90 monitor the output signal to determine the position of the window relative to the window frame and compare the output signal generated by the photointerrupter 118 to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window 26 and window frame 28 . A description of the method of detecting the position of a window in a window frame of a vehicle door assembly of the present invention is described in greater detail below . A window position detection and anti-pinch system 36 described above is provided to monitor the position of the window 26 relative to the window frame 28 . As is shown in FIGS . 1-6 , sensing device 42 , 76 , 78 are positioned adjacent window 26 and detect the binary coding of coding arrangement 40 , 74 on window pane 26 a the window is raised and lowered to determine the position of the window relative to the window frame . Sensing device 42 , 76 , 78 generate output signal based on the vertical position of the window in the window frame detected by the sensor . As shown in FIGS . 7-10 , encoder 92 monitor the position of window 26 based on the rotational movement of rotary member 94 . This information is transmitted from the sensing device to the controller 44 for analysis . When the operator actuates switch 48 , a signal is sent to controller 44 to activate reversible drive motor 38 to raise or lower window 26 in window frame 28 . Simultaneously , controller 44 activates the window position detection and anti-pinch system to monitor the travel of the window a the drive motor 38 raise or lower window 26 . The controller 44 is responsive to the output signal generated by the sensing device of system 36 to detect window position relative to the window frame 28 . Controller 44 compare output signal against predetermined value to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window 26 and window frame 28 . If the controller detects a discrepancy in the time interval between interrupt signal corresponding to window distance traveled , controller 44 will generate a control signal to stop and reverse motor 38 . Motor 38 will then lower the window 26 to allow an occupant to remove the object or obstruction from between the window and window frame . Additionally , system 36 may also generate a visual or audible warning for the occupant of a vehicle in response to a mismatched value found by controller 44 . While embodiment of the invention have been illustrated and described , it is not intended that these embodiment illustrate and describe all possible form of the invention . Rather , the word used in the specification are word of description rather than limitation , and it is understood that various change may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention ."
