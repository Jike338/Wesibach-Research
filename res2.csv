afnium oxide and three layers ( 3 mono-layers ) of aluminum oxide is set to be several seconds . Then the above formation process of the one layer ( 1 mono-layer ) of hafnium oxide and three layers of aluminum oxide is repeatedly performed . By these operations the upper layer gate insulating film 18 made of amorphous hafnium aliminate having a specified composition ratio is formed when viewed macroscopically . Moreover in the embodiment a film thickness of the upper layer insulating film 18 is about one third or more of that of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 . Next a gate electrode made of for example polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . That is as shown in FIG . 3D an electrode layer 19 made of polycrystalline silicon ( p-Si ) having a film thickness of for example 50 ( 5 nm ) is deposited on the upper layer gate insulating film 18 by using a CVD ( Chemical vapor Deposition ) method . Next as shown in FIG . 4A a gate electrode 6 is formed by performing patterning operations using photolithography and etching technology . As shown in FIG . 8 a hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 8 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( 0dda ) and to be for example 25 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( daddg ) and is set so as to be discontinuously change at a boundary region ( d=da ) . Here da represents a thickness of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and dg represents a total thickness of the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . In this case an aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and to be 75 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 18 and a relation of [ Na [ % ] =100Nh ] is maintained . Then after specified impurities have been implanted into the silicon substrate 3 by using the gate electrode 6 as a mask an annealing process is performed at a temperature of for example 1000 C. to form the source-drain region 2 as shown in FIG . 4B . Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and upper layer gate insulating film 18 the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion as a result causing the boundary to disappear and the single layer gate insulating film 5 to be formed . Thus the FET 1 as shown in FIG . 1 is obtained . Next a characteristic in the region in the obtained FET 1 where the gate insulating film 5 is formed is described by referring to FIG . 1 and FIG . 9 . Especially in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 shown in FIG . 1 since the region is positioned immediately below the gate electrode 6 the concentration of aluminum is set to be comparatively high . This enables prevention of degradation of the EOT of the gate insulating film 5 caused by use of polycrystalline silicon ( polycrystalline semiconductor ) as the material for the gate electrode 6 and by use of only hafnium oxide as the material for the gate insulating film 5 and thus enables suppression of lowering in electrostatic capacitance which serves to reduce leakage currents . Moreover since the gate insulating film 5 contains a specified concentration of hafnium lowering of a dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 is suppressed which serves to ensure a required EOT . Also since in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be relatively high lowering in the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 is suppressed thus serving to ensure the required EOT and at the same time since a specified concentration of aluminum is contained crystallization of hafnium oxide can be prevented . Therefore occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppressed thus serving to prevent an increase in leakage currents . Moreover an investigation of a relation between the EOT and leakage current density made to evaluate a characteristic of the FET 1 shows good results as shown in FIG . 9 . In FIG . 9 a characteristic curve L1 shows a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density in the FET 1 of the embodiment . Also a characteristic curve La shows a relation between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when metals are used as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide . Furthermore characteristic curves Lb Lc and Ld show relations between the EOT and the leakage current density obtained when polycrystalline silicon is used as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide only aluminum oxide and only silicon oxide respectively . As shown in FIG . 9 in the case of the FET 1 of the embodiment the EOT is greatly reduced when compared with the case where the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide and its characteristic comes near to that obtained when metals are used as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide . Thus according to the configurations of the FET of the embodiment since in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 whose thickness occupies about three fourths of all thickness of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of hafnium being a material having a high dielectric constant is made comparatively high and since also in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 hafnium is contained in a specified concentration it is possible to suppress lowering of the dielectric constant of the entire gate insulating film 5 and to ensure the required EOT . Moreover since in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 the concentration of aluminum is made comparatively high and since in the region immediately below the gate electrode 6 the aluminum concentration Na is made particularly high when polycrystalline silicon ( polycrystalline semiconductor ) is used as the material for the gate electrode 6 and the gate insulating film 5 is made up of only hafnium oxide it is possible to suppress lowering of an electrostatic capacitance that is to prevent degradation of the EOT and to reduce leakage currents . Also not only in the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 but also in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 in which the concentration of hafnium is set to be relatively high aluminum is contained in a specified concentration which enables crystallization of hafnium oxide to be suppressed . As a result occurrence of a grain boundary passing through the gate insulating film 5 can be suppressed and an increase in leakage currents can be prevented . This enables dielectric breakdown to be reduced thus improving reliability of the semiconductor device . Also since crystallization of hafnium oxide can be suppressed surface roughness can be improved and a local concentration of electric fields in a region in which film thickness is small can be avoided which enables leakage currents to be reduced thus improving reliability of the semiconductor device . Moreover by providing heat treatment after the upper layer gate insulating film 18 has been deposited on the lower layer gate insulating film 8 the aluminum concentration Na and hafnium concentration Nh can be made changeable continuously in the boundary region it is possible to prevent such a problem as a decrease in a threshold value of the gate insulating film 5 caused by trapped electric charges in the boundary region . Also since the ALD method is used to form the gate insulating film 5 improvement of film quality of the gate insulating film 5 is made possible by precisely controlling concentrations of aluminum and hafnium and contamination caused by carbon contained in the material gas can be prevented by introducing the purge gas .

FIG . 11 is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating configurations of intermediate regions in a gate insulating film of the FET 21 of the second embodiment . FIG . 12 is a characteristic diagram briefly showing a relation between a distance from an interface of the gate insulating film on a substrate side in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 and a hafnium concentration Nh obtained after heat treatment in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . FIGS . 13A 13B and 13C are process diagrams illustrating a method for manufacturing the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . FIG . 14 is a characteristic diagram briefly showing a relation between a distance from the interface of the gate insulating film on the substrate side in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 and a hafnium concentration Nh obtained before heat treatment in the gate insulating film making up the FET 21 of FIG . 10 . The FET 21 of the second embodiment differs greatly from the FET 1 employed in the first embodiment in that in the first embodiment after the lower layer insulating film 8 and upper layer insulating film 18 have been formed concentrations are continuously changed at the boundary region 5 c in a process of heat treatment however in the second embodiment after a plurality of intermediate insulating films whose hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are changed in stages has been formed between a lower gate insulating film and an upper gate insulating film and a heat treatment process is performed . Configurations other than described above are almost the same as those in the first embodiment and their descriptions are made simple accordingly . The FET ( semiconductor device ) 21 of the second embodiment as shown in FIG . 10 includes a silicon substrate 23 having a source-drain region 22 into which specified impurities have been implanted is formed a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide being deposited on the silicon substrate 23 a gate insulating film 25 formed on the seed layer 24 a gate electrode 26 made of for example polycrystalline silicon being deposited on the gate insulating film 25 . The gate insulating film 25 has a specified thickness ( for example 20 to 50 that is about 2 nm to 5 nm ) and is so formed that each of composition ratios changes along a direction of its thickness toward the gate electrode 6 from a side of the silicon substrate 23 thus causing a hafnium concentration Nh to monotonously become lower and an aluminum concentration Na to monotonously become higher . Moreover as shown in FIG . 10 the gate insulating film 25 has a region 25 a ( first insulating region ) on a lower layer side immediately above the silicon substrate 23 a region 25 b ( second insulating region ) on an upper layer side immediately below the gate electrode 26 and an intermediate region 25 c ( third insulating region ) being sandwiched between the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side and both the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are almost constant in each of the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the region 25 b on the upper layer side . As shown in FIG . 11 and FIG . 12 the intermediate region 25 c ( d3dd10 ) has a first intermediate region 25 p ( d4dd5 ) a second intermediate region 25 q ( d6dd7 ) a third intermediate region 25 r ( d8dd9 ) a boundary region 25 s ( d3dd4 ) between the region 25 a on the lower layer side and the first intermediate region 25 p a boundary region 25 t ( d5dd6 ) between the first intermediate region 25 p and the secondary intermediate region 25 q a boundary region 25 u ( d7dd8 ) between the second intermediate region 25 q and the third intermediate region 25 r and a boundary region 25 v ( d9dd10 ) between the third intermediate region 25 r and region 25 b on the upper layer side . Here in the first intermediate region 25 p second intermediate region 25 q and third intermediate region 25 r each of the hafnium and the aluminum has a specified concentration being almost constant and in the boundary region 25 s the boundary region 25 t the boundary region 25 u and the boundary region 25 v each of the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na continuously changes . As shown in FIG . 12 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the region 25 a on the lower layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be for example 25 % in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and changes continuously and in stages in the intermediate region 25 c. In this case the aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the region 25 a on the lower layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and to be 75 % in the region 25 b on the upper layer side in the gate insulating film 25 and a relation of ( Na=100Nh ) is maintained . Next a method for manufacturing the FET 21 of the second embodiment is described by referring to FIG . 13 . First as shown in FIG . 13A a seed layer 24 made of silicon oxide is formed on a silicon substrate 23 by the thermal oxidation method . Then a lower layer gate insulating film 27 made of hafnium aluminate containing a specified concentration of hafnium and aluminum is formed on the seed layer 24 by the ALD method . Then the first intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 28 second intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 29 third intermediate insulating film ( third insulating film ) 31 are formed on the lower layer gate insulating film 27 in a manner that the hafnium concentration Nh becomes lower in order ( the aluminum concentration Na becomes higher in order ) . Next the upper layer gate insulating film 32 whose hafnium concentration Nh is made lower than that of the third intermediate insulating film 31 is formed on the third intermediate insulating film 31 . Then an electrode layer 33 made of polycrystalline silicon is formed on the upper layer gate insulating film 32 for example by the CVD method . Then as shown in FIG . 13B a gate electrode 26 is formed by performing patterning operations using photolithography and etching technology . As shown in FIG . 14 the hafnium concentration Nh is set to be for example 75 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 27 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( 0ddb ) and to be for example 25 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 that is in a region with a distance d from an interface of the gate insulating film 27 on a side of the substrate being within a range of ( dfddg ) and is set to be a specified constant value so as to become lower in order within a range of ( 25 % Nh75 % ) in each of the first intermediate insulating film 28 that is in a region within a range of ( dbddc ) the second intermediate insulating film 29 that is in a region within a range of ( dcdde ) and the third intermediate insulating film 31 ( deddf ) and is set so as to discontinuously change in each of the boundary regions ( d=db dc de and df ) . In this case the aluminum concentration Na is set to be 25 % in the lower layer gate insulating film 27 and to be 75 % in the upper layer gate insulating film 32 and a relation of Na [ % ] =100Nh is maintained . Then after specified impurities have been implanted into the silicon substrate 23 by using the gate electrode 26 as a mask an annealing process is performed to form a source-drain region 22 as shown in FIG . 13C . Here during the heat treatment in the process of the source-drain region formation in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 27 and the first intermediate insulating film 28 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the first intermediate insulating film 28 and the second intermediate insulating film 29 in a region in the vicinity of a boundary between the second intermediate insulating film 29 and the third intermediate insulating film 31 and in a region in the vicinity of the third intermediate insulating film 31 and the upper layer gate insulating film 32 the change in the concentrations of hafnium or aluminum becomes mild due to thermal diffusion causing the boundary to disappear and as a result the single layer gate insulating film 25 to be formed . Thus the FET 21 as shown in FIG . 10 is obtained . According to the second embodiment almost the same effect as achieved in the first embodiment described above can be obtained . Additionally since the change in concentrations in the boundary region is made more mild the characteristic can be more improved . It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments but may be changed and modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention . For example in the above embodiments the gate insulating films 5 and 25 are formed by the ALD method however instead of the ALD method the CVD method can be used for forming the gate insulating films 5 or 25 . This enables a throughput ( processing capability ) to be improved . The CVD method that can be used here includes for example an atmospheric CVD method a reduced pressure CVD method a plasma enhanced CVD method or a like . Moreover the gate electrode can be formed as a multi-layer structure in which metals layers are stacked on a polycrystalline layer . Polycrystalline silicon-germanium [ SiGe ] instead of polycrystalline silicon can be used as a material for the gate electrode . The material gas that can be used when the gate insulating films 5 or 25 are formed by the ALD method includes Hf ( NMe2 ) 4 [ tetrakis ( dimethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( NEt2 ) 4 [ tetrakis ( diethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( NMeEt ) 4 [ tetrakis ( methylethylamino ) hafnium ] Hf ( t-Bu ) 4 [ tetra t-butyl hafnium ] instead of HfCl4 [ hafnium tetrachloride ] . Also as the oxidizing agent instead of ozone ( O3 ) oxygen ( O2 ) or water ( H2O ) may be used . The formation of the seed layer 4 or 24 may be omitted . In the above embodiments by the thermal treatment in the process of forming the source-drain region the concentration of hafnium or aluminum is changed continuously in a region in the vicinity of the boundary between the lower layer gate insulating film 8 and the upper layer gate insulating film 18 . However to make continuous the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum a thermal treatment in a process of forming a gate electrode may be used or a thermal treatment process to make mild the change in the concentration of hafnium or aluminum may be provided separately . The temperature for the thermal treatment is set to be within a range between 800 C. or more and 1000 C. or less . Also in the above first embodiment the boundary region 5 c is formed where the hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are continuously changed along a thickness direction of the gate insulating film 5 by the thermal treatment however the FET of the present invention may be so constructed as to have an interface instead of the boundary region 5 c. Moreover in the first embodiment each of the hafnium concentration Nh and the aluminum concentration Na is constant in the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 and the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 however the present invention is not limited to this that is the FET may be constructed so that the hafnium concentration Nh becomes lower and the aluminum concentration Na becomes higher in these regions 5 a and 5 b along a direction from a side of the substrate to a side of the gate electrode . In the first embodiment the thickness of the region 5 a on the lower layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about three fourths and the thickness of the region 5 b on the upper layer side of the gate insulating film 5 occupies about one fourth however the present invention is not limited to this that is a ratio of the thickness of the upper layer region 5 b may be made higher . Furthermore in the second embodiment the three layers of the intermediate insulating films each having a different hafnium concentration Nh and aluminum concentration Na are formed however the present invention is not limited to this that is two layers or four layers or more of the intermediate insulating films may be formed . ''
sly placed in the oxide 30 the silicon of the rocker 39 can be contacted directly both mechanically and electrically . If an electrical insulation of the sensor diaphragm from the torsion rocker 39 is later desired for instance for the sake of electrical shielding from the environment then before the polysilicon is deposited an insulating layer can be deposited that is not attacked by the HF vapor chemistry employed afterward for sacrificial oxide etching . An example of something suitable for this is a layer of amorphous silicon carbide which is resistant both to media that contain hydrofluoric acid and to HF vapor . This layer can be structured after the conformal deposition above the contact hole in the oxide either by a masked etching process such that only the coupling element 42 remains or can be machined in such a way that after a grinding process the coupling element 42 remains enclosed by the oxide 30 . It is understood that in that case the order of the process steps can also be reversed ; that is the coupling element 42 ( for instance of amorphous silicon carbide ) is applied first and then the filler oxide is deposited and planarized and then the entire covering 13 is deposited and planarized taking into account the pressure adjustment process parameters set beforehand . By the two production variants for the coupling element 42that is simple polysilicon deposition with mechanical connection via the polysilicon which it is understood fills up the contact hole in the oxide 30 and thus establishes the nonpositive engagement with the rocker 39 or the explicit deposition and production of an electrically insulated coupling element 42 by means of an addition layera mechanical connection is created between the covering 13 and the torsion rocker 39 . Because of the bending form of the covering 13 that is subjected to pressure it is advantageous to place the coupling element 42 between the torsion axis and the center of the cover plate or accordingly for exampleas seen in FIGS . 17 18to the right of the torsion axis of the rocker 39 and to the left of the middle of the diaphragm . If pressure is exerted on the diaphragm a bending line in the form of a double-S ensues which presses the right-hand half of the rocker 39 downward and the left-hand half of the rocker 39 accordingly moves upward . If there are two counterelectrodes ( structured from the conductive layer 14 ) underneath the rocker 39 then the change in capacitance can be processed as a differential capacitance by means of suitable evaluation electronics . The electrical wiring of the sensor component is done in the bottom plane through the conductive layer 14 buried there . Such a sensor with the layout described has an advantageously low temperature drift because of its symmetry and the capacitive assessment by the differential capacitor array making it possible to dispense with an expensive calibration and temperature compensation . If the explicit differential capacitor array is dispensed then a simpler process and design in accordance with FIGS . 19 and 20 can be considered . The seismic mass 44 is joined directly to the deposition layer 32 . Also in the way described above a reference pressure preferably by means of helium gas can be enclosed in the sensor chamber 28 and the structure can be hermetically sealed by sealing of the sealing layer 34 . If pressure is exerted on the structure the mass 44 is pressed downward thus decreasing the spacing from the layer 14 lying below which functions as a counterelectrode and a change in capacitance accordingly ensues . The electrical connection and the embodiment of the counterpart electrode can in turn be accomplished via the layer 14 and extended to the outside . One thus obtains a simple robust capacitive pressure sensor by means of surface micromechanics . The evaluation electronics developed in standard form for acceleration sensors can continue to be used if a differential capacitor array is embodied by a fixed-value capacitor connected externally to the measuring capacitor . The permeability of the deposition layer 32 for the etching medium and the resultant reaction products can also be forced retroactively after deposition of the layer 32 . A first method of this kind is sketched in FIGS . 21-23 in which an electrochemical etching operation is primarily used for converting silicon into ( permeable ) porous silicon . Firstas already describedthe procedure is the same up to and including the deposition of the deposition layer 32 . Next a suitable masking layer 46 is applied ( FIG . 21 ) and in a known manner such as by an additional lithography step structuring is performed so that a region 48 in which the properties of the layer 32 are to be varied or modified is made accessible ( FIG . 22 ) . The actual electrochemical etching operation is performed in the presence of an HF electrolyte such as a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol and leads to the formation of porous structures or etching openings in the regions 48 of the layer 32 that are exposed to the electrolyte . It has proved especially advantageous in the electrochemical etching operations of the type described to perform an irradiation of the surface in addition in a wavelength range from 100 nm to 1000 nm and in particular 350 nm to 800 nm since the homogeneity of the process is improved thereby . An electrical connection by application of an anodic potential can be done on the one hand via the top side of the layer 32 and on the other from the epipolysilicon layer 16 or the foundation wafer 11 ( back-side contact ) via the underside of the layer 32 . The large-area back-side contact via the foundation wafer 11 has the advantage that with it a better-defined more-homogeneous distribution of current density of the anodizing current is achieved since the current has to overcome a maximum of only the thickness of the foundation wafer 11 in order to reach the region 48 to be treated . Expediently a high n-doping of the layers of the foundation wafer 11above all the wafer underside of the substrate ( 10 ) is provided ( n++ ) which becomes possible especially simply by POCL deposition and ensuing forcing of phosphorous into the silicon but also by ion implantation of phosphorous arsenic or antimony . The n++ doping of the back side of the foundation wafer 11 reduces the Schottky barrier that is present in the electrolyte/silicon contact region . Suitably adapted doping of the layer 32 in the region 48 that is to be varied can be used to control the process . It has been demonstrated for instance that p-doping leads to the formation of mesoporous pores while n-doping leads to etching openings ranging from a few tens of nanometers to micrometers . Alternatively to the electrochemical etching operation the procedure can be as shown in FIGS . 24-27 for exemplary embodiments . First the still inadequately permeable layer 32 is applied and next using known masking methods a metal layer is deposited and structured . In the ensuing galvanic production of porous polysilicon in the region 48 the metal thus simultaneously takes on the function both of masking the silicon surface of the layer 32 in the regions that are not to be electrochemically anodized and of a cathode in the galvanic silicon/electrolyte/metal cell . The processes that lead to the formation of the porous polysilicon can be controlled via the composition of the HF electrolyte and via the incident current density in this galvanic cell . The current densities are dependent on the ratio of area of metal to silicon . The larger the metal area the higher the current density . Typical metal to silicon area ratios are between 10 and 20 to 1 . The advantage of this technique is that electrical contacting of the wafer is not necessary . To achieve these ratios parts of the metal face of the region 48 which is to be made porous of the covering 13 can be covered with a grid . Care should be taken that the width of the metal tracks is greater than the thickness of the layer 32 to be etched because otherwise excessive underetching and detachment of the metal could occur . A selection among possible embodiments can be learned from the plan views and sectional views of FIGS . 24-27 . It is also conceivable by a modified stain-etch operation to treat the regions 48 that are to be made porous with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid nitric acid and water . All the other regions must be protected with a suitable masking layer for instance of silicon nitride . By way of the composition and in particular the nitric acid concentration and the exposure times the porosity and layer thickness of the modified porous silicon region can be controlled . Moreover there is an empirically detectable influence of dopants making it possible to control the process that creates the porosity . A further alternative embodiment of the thin-film sensor cap in which support elements 50 are present on the underside of the deposition layer 32 can be seen in FIGS . 28-31 . Up to the deposition of the oxide 30 as shown in FIG . 6 the method described at the outset can be employed . However a complete planarization of the oxide film 30 down to the height of the epipolysilicon layer 16 is dispensed with . Instead a structured removal of material is done in which the oxide 30 is removed from those regions that are later to form the support elements 50 . These regions are logically located above the regions of the epipolysilicon layer 16 which are not supposed to be further attacked in the ensuing etching process . The individual support elements 50 are typically encompassing support struts or support columns which thus define the sensor chamber 28 that is covered by the covering 13 . The necessary micromechanical structures 26 are located inside the sensor chamber 28 . In accordance with FIG . 28 slight spacings of the support elements 50 and thus slight clamping widths of the covering 13 can be achieved . Clamping widths below 10 m are thus feasible . However this also means reduced sagging upon subjection to an overpressure and the spacing of the covering 13 and the sensor element can be reduced so much that it is impossible to lift the sensor structure 26 out in the event of a mechanical overload . Since the bond frames necessary in the conventional sensors can be drastically reduced in size a major reduction in surface area additional ensues so that more than twice as many acceleration sensors can be processed on the same foundation wafer 11 . FIG . 31 in this respect shows a further advantageous embodiment with T-shaped support elements 50 which lead to especially stable structures . For the case where instead of using a permeable polysilicon as the deposition layer 32 etching openings 52 by way of which the sacrificial oxide etching takes place are to be made retroactively the design shown in FIG . 2 has proved advantageous . The etching openings 52 are disposed here such that upon the deposition of the sealing layer 34 at most the structural elements 53 of the sensor that are not fundamental to its function are exposed to the deposition plasma . These structural elements 53 that are not fundamental to the function are in fact precisely those elements that are connected to the support elements 50 . After the sacrificial etching it is optionally possible via the etching openings 52 to deposit suitable anti-adhesion layers in the region of the structures 26 as well . A sensor in accordance with FIG . 30 can be made with the aid of the process steps described above . Along with the possibility described in conjunction with FIGS . 15 and 16 of simultaneously structuring both the deposition layer 32 and the layer 34 or of initially not structuring the deposition layer 32 and initially leaving it over the full surface and only at the end etching contact pads 36 that are electrically insulated from the system it is also possible to machine the epipolysilicon layer 16 located beneath so that the opening 54 by way of which contacting can later be done can be created in one process step . In electrochemical etching contacting in turn occurs via the back side of the wafer . The layers are then electrically connected via the support elements 50 so that a preferably high permeability is established in the region of the support elements 50 by the formation of porous silicon . This electrical contacting of the layer 32 can also be done next to the sensor region 28 toward the substrate 10 . ''
