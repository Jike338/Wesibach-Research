To alt ltvmm it muy confirm `13e tt. known that I, Joni: Hochmut, of 'lhomnstoin in the Stute of Moine, have n vented n new sind useful improvement or tltprovcments on locomotive-engines used on railroads and common roads by which inclined planes and hills muy he ascended and heavy loads drawn up the suine with more facility and eeonomv than heretofore, ncl hywhich the evil eflects of frost. ice, snows.. and nnn'l yon the ruil causing the wheels to slide nre obVinted. The ohstucles met with in ascending inclined planes jtvith locomotives drawing heavy loads after them, are 'the want of power in the engine; and the deficiency of adhesion to the railsgmy improvements arel desi ned to give n multiplied ttnctive power to l 1e locomotive and to prevent the evilof the sliding of the wheels., and for these. improvements I havemnde application for e potent to be issued according to the ypro visions of law. The 'followin is1afull and exa'ct description of sai improvementa To werent. `the Awheelsgfroni sliding on the rails make use of n check rnil,and retreating regs, the cogs are applied in the following manner, the wheels are. made in the common forni except, that the rim is somewhat wider from the flange to the nutside of the trend it should be no wider than to pass the rail sufficiently, and its width must. he further extended 12 inches. This extended part of the rim at the periphery thereof is li inches 'less in diameter than the hearing periphery. v The accompanying drawings are mntle a port of and are referred to in this desription for the better understanding thereof. A transverse section of the rim is seen at n. in Figure 2, Mnl it is more fully shown l in Fig. 3. 'This extended rim is pierced. with tearing 24 holes. or square sockets, where the wheel hats l2 spokes. for thc reception of the retreatin"" (lugs, they are l-l inches square :it equal. tliel'uncea;v apart, and 1ll inch from the part. of the run, the rugs nuove freely tn these .sockets in the direction of the radii they :tre vshown nl, Ii, b. b.

'ihctr nction is uttentirtl with rcry little frictione acting only when necessary to supply the deficiency of adhesion and their pressure against the tlnnlr of the teeth is only the balance of leverage which is not sustained by the sdhesion at the treed. They are not subject to the evils attending the use aliixed coge which must almost necessaril be broken in their first contact with s rocrr leid st the foot, or top' of an inclined plane if they do not chance to enter into geur, and whose stubbornness subjects them to frequent accidents, and injury, besides the great friction which attends their action under all circumstances. The retreating coge are endowed with the fncuity of getting out of the way when not wanted, and of instantly being in service without prompting, when their need is necessary. For planes much inclined the distance between the teeth should be such that the coge shall over lay them about 1l, of an inch. The coge should be applied to each of the workin wheels. To enab e locomotives to ascend inclined planes with heavy loads it is necessary also to give them sn increased trsctive power; I effect thlt object in the following manner, which in described es sp lieeble to geared locomotive engines, but a locomotives may be geared for this purpose. There are the driving shaft takin its motion from the connecting rod and t e followingshsft communicating the motion to the msm werking wheels by cranks, and shackle-bars. On the drivin shaft are oog wheels A., C, Fig. 4, fixed t0 the shaft, on the following shaft are ccrresponding wheels B, and. ke t eontantly in gear with A, and C. B, and are loose on the shaft, and revolve freely around it excet when the are alternately fixed, and heldptirmlv by e spears E and F, on either side of B, and D, are the supports G, and H, fixed to the shaft, they are perforated for the blades of the spears to pass throu h and enter between the urmsof the oog weels. The gs har l hss two forks whose rongsliein e ooves around the w ich are moved s together laterally y means of l. lever applied bo the gege'- bar, conveniently laced under the commend of the engineer, e spears have the aid of s feather on the shaft, as well es of the su rta G and H. By this means the whee s 1nd D are alternately held fest to the shaft as occasion may nire, when one is fast, the other revolves reely around the shaft without impediment to the one in service. It is readily ived that by increasing the diameter o the wheel D, and diminishing C, the tractive wer of the engine may be increased four old if desired in chan ing the running gear as above described. and B, are the common moving gear combin ing in due proportion speed, und power for the level, and moderately undulating part ofthe rond. On enterin upon the ascent of un inclined plane, or hi as the momentum acquired on the level is spent, and the power of the engine begins to fai, the engineer, cutting o the steam for nn instant, removes the spear E, and brings the other into gear by a single motion of the lever, without stopping the progress of the locomotive. lt is t us enabled to move on up the lane with less speed than un a level but wit u redonbled power. When arrived at the summit the other wheels are brought into action again in like manner, and the locomotive proceeds with its accustomed speed. 'lhc trsctive power of the engine may be thus doubled, trebled, or quadrupled to adapt it to the rading of the road on which ii. ig L0 be Another mode of changing tho gearing b holding fast the two wheels B, and D, a ternately is by means of levcrs placed in a. groovelengthwise the shalt, one srm of which being raised operates like s feather entering s notch or groove in the bush of the wheel, the xrms of the levers nre raised, and depressed by n slide, and gage bar ss shown in Fi 5. Another mode isiy moving the wheels E, and D, into, und out of ar ulternstel by s lst/eral motion on the s aft, effected y s gege bar with arms, es shown in Fig. tl, us also another mode as at Fig. 7. I have also s method of drewin the retreating cogs within their sockets. ut I do not consider this as neeessa to their successful ap liestion and use. t is however describe here as there may be circumstances undermhich its adoption may be useful. It is thus: the rod attached to the cog is continued of n. diminished size, not exceeding 11 of an inch, to within 1i inches of the nave where'it psssen freely through the end of a lever which lifts against n. nut on the ond of the rod. This lever seen nt in Figs. 2 and 3, passes in the direction of the axle inward, moves on s ivot in the projecting part of the nave nt and the other arm inclines toward the a as shown in Fi'f's. 2 and 3. Encirclin the axle at l, is a. circular slide through olea in which the arms of the levera pesa, und when moved on the axle from thensve it raises the arms from the axle, and thus draws the coge within their sockets. This slide is moved by the gage bar M, havin prongs which rest in the groove aroun the outer ed e of the slide This like the other gage are, are moved endwise in fixtures by means of l lever placed in any convenient manner to be within reach of the engineer. By this means whether the engine be nt rest or in motion, all the coge are drawn into their sockets at once by s single motion of the engineer. There is one lever between each two spokes, each raising two cogs. The principal advantage of this is the withdrawing the cogs from uction in not claim the aaid descending a plane, where a check ruil in laid when eir use is not neeeary, and thus avoiding the=wear of them. It may be found useful too on curves in an ascending plane to withdraw the cop of the inside wheels from action, facilitating the adjudment of the wheels to the curved rails. Now what I a my invention arr- 1. The retreating ooge operated u by a spring, and the manner by which oy are made to operate with trilli frictionl and the combination therewith o the machinery by which they are drawn into their sockets, and their application in connection with a check rail to prevent the sliding of the whelelaofa looomotiveonthorailnofi'nrnil` roa 2.
