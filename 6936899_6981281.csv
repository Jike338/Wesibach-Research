DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Please refer to FIG. 3, which is a schematic diagram showing a circuit of a dimming control system of a discharge lamp according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system is used in single or several discharge lamps 12 for controlling the light intensity. This system includes a voltage regulator 31 which could be a power supply or a transformer, and a ballast circuit 32. The voltage regulator 31 provides a variable output voltage while receiving an AC line voltage Vac. The variable output voltage is a bus voltage Vbus. The level of the bus voltage is a predetermined ratio of the amplitude of the input AC line voltage Vac. For example, ten percentage of the amplitude of the AC line voltage Vac equals to the level of the bus voltage Vbus. The bus voltage Vbus is supplied to the ballast circuit 32. The output power supplied by the ballast circuit 32 is determined according to the variation of the bus voltage for controlling the light intensity of a discharge lamp 12. The circuit structure and the operation method of the ballast circuit 32 can be well illustrated in FIG. 4. Please refer to FIG. 4, which is a schematic diagram showing a circuit of a ballast circuit in a dimming control system of a discharge lamp according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The ballast circuit 32 includes a rectifier 34 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The rectifier 34 is a bridge circuit consisting of four rectified diodes for rectifying the bus voltage Vbus. The ballast circuit 32 further includes a voltage converter 35 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The voltage converter 35 is preferably composed of an operational amplifier, OP Amp, for serving as a dimming signal generator, a voltage divider having two resistors, R1 and R2, for offering an input voltage to the operational amplifier, and a reference voltage, Vref, for offering a reference voltage to the operational amplifier. The operational amplifier detects the variation of the bus voltage (Vbus) and thereby amplifies the variations for generating a dimming signal Vset. The dimming signal Vset is used to drive a ballast control integrated circuit 37. An inverter 36 consists of at least one Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) 361 for example. The On/Off operation of a MOSFET 361 is controlled by the ballast control integrated circuit 37. The ballast control integrated circuit 37 is a MOS driver. The ballast control integrated circuit 37 needs a microcontroller (not shown) for providing two control signals to start the control function, and a power supply (not shown) for providing the power source for operating. The ballast control integrated circuit 37 controls the operation of the MOSFET 361 according to the value of the dimming signal Vset for controlling the output power supplied to the discharge lamp 12, while receiving the dimming signal Vset in response to the variations of the bus voltage Vbus. An inductor 38 will act in different way by the On/Off operation of the MOSFET 361. The inductor 38 stores the energy while the MOSFET 361 is On. On the contrary, the energy is provided from the inductor 38 to the discharge lamp 12 for driving the discharge lamp while the MOSFET 361 is Off. Therefore, the ballast control integrated circuit 37 can control the switching frequency of the MOSFET 361 according to the value of the dimming signal Vset, i.e. the variation of the bus voltage Vbus. And then, the ballast control integrated circuit 37 can further controls the output power or energy output to the discharge lamp 12. The ballast circuit 32 further includes two bulk capacitors, C1 and C2, coupled to the half-bridge circuit of the inverter 36, and a resonant capacitor, C3, coupled to the inductor 38 to form the resonant LC circuit. Another method can be used to control the light intensity of the discharge lamp 12 is based on the theory of altering the frequency of the inverter 36 of the ballast circuit 32 for adjusting the lamp current according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. And then, the lamp current of each discharge lamp will be kept in a fixed value. In conclusion, the present invention provides a dimming control system for a discharge lamp. It is used not only efficiently but also conveniently to control the light intensity while we want to start the discharge lamp at random luminance and don't want to alter the present arrangement of the two-line power line. Especially, a simple circuit is able to be used in the dimming control system of the present invention. The dimming control system of the present invention can be used to accurately regulate the discharge lamp light intensity ranged from 0% to 100%. So, the dimming control system for a discharge lamp of the present invention is real simple and has a wide dimming range.

The Government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND Embodiments of the present invention relate to the generation of a pattern on a substrate using electron beams. A conventional electron beam pattern generator typically comprises an electron beam column in which a single electron beam is generated, modulated, and directed onto a substrate to expose an electron-sensitive resist material on the substrate. A substrate support is used to support and move the substrate. An electron beam source generates the electron beam. A beam modulator modulates the intensity of the electron beam. Beam optics are used to focus the electron beam. A beam scanner is used to scan the electron beam across the substrate. One problem with conventional pattern generators is that these systems typically use a single beam and, consequently, generate a pattern at relatively slow speeds because pixels are sequential exposed on the substrate in series. The exposure rate of single beam systems is further limited by the total beam current. As the total beam current is increased, electron to electron interactions cause excessive proximity errors by undesirably exposing regions of the substrate that neighbor target regions. Multiple electron beam pattern generators use a plurality of electron beams to generate an electron beam pattern on a substrate and, consequently, can generally operate with better resolution and at higher speeds than single electron beam pattern generators. The multiple electron beams are accelerated to a high velocity at which they can be drawn from the electron source as separate and well-defined beams. However, the multiplicity and close spacing of the individual electron beams also result in distortions of the electron beams that limit the quality of the pattern formed on the substrate. For example, as the electron beams propagate towards the substrate, space charge interactions occur between the electrons in neighboring electron beams, blurring and distorting the cross-sectional shape of the electron beams. As the total beam current is increased, electron to electron interactions limit beam resolution, and hence upper limits are placed on beam current and exposure rate to ensure adequate optical resolution and critical dimension control. Also, as the electron beams impinge on the substrate, the degree of exposure of a region on the substrate by one electron beam is undesirably affected by neighboring electron beams that simultaneously impinge on the substrate. Undesirable exposure can result from electrons from individual beams scattering upon impact and also due to localized heating of the substrate from the energy of multiple beams. In addition, cross-over regions where the multiple electron beams cross-over one another, such as during focusing of the beams, can result in beam to beam interactions that further reduce the resolution of the beams and increase beam error functions. It is desirable to generate a pattern on a substrate using multiple electron beams having reduced beam interactions. It is further desirable to have a system capable of generating a pattern with multiple electron beams that exhibits reduced scattering or localized heating effects. It is also desirable to have a multiple electron beam pattern generating system capable of providing high exposure rate with good resolution. SUMMARY A multiple electron beam pattern generator comprises a multiple electron beam source to generate a plurality of electron beams that are modulated according to a pattern. An anode accelerates the electron beams and beam optics focus the electron beams. A beam retarding system generates a retarding electric potential about the electron beams to decrease the kinetic energy of the electron beams substantially near a substrate. A beam scanner scans the electron beams across the substrate. A substrate support supports the substrate so that a pattern may be generated on the substrate. In another version, the multiple electron beam pattern generator has a multiple electron beam source to generate a plurality of electron beams that are modulated according to a pattern and directed along a path. A substrate support supports the substrate. An anode is provided, as well as an anode voltage supply to apply a first electric potential to the anode to accelerate the electron beams. Beam optics focus the electron beams. A retarding electrode is provided between the anode and the substrate support along the path of the electron beams, and a retarding voltage supply applies a second electric potential to the retarding electrode, the second electric potential being lower than the first electric potential. A beam scanner scans the electron beams across the substrate, and a pattern is generated on the substrate. A method of generating an electron beam pattern on a substrate comprises generating a plurality of electron beams that are modulated according to a pattern. The electron beams are accelerated and focused. A retarding electric potential is maintained about the electron beams to decrease the kinetic energy of the electron beams substantially near a substrate. The electron beams are scanned across the substrate, and a pattern is generated on the substrate. In another version, the multiple electron beam pattern generator comprises a multiple electron beam source to generate a plurality of electron beams that are modulated according to a grayscale intensity pattern. The beam retarding system retards the electron beams from a kinetic energy in the range of from about 10 keV to about 100 keV to a kinetic energy in the range of from about 100 eV to about 5 keV substantially near the substrate.

DESCRIPTION Embodiments of a multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 are used to generate a pattern on a substrate 105 using multiple electron beams 110, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The illustrative apparatus provided herein should not be used to limit the scope of the invention, and the invention encompasses equivalent or alternative versions, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 is suitable for generating a pattern on a substrate 105 that comprises one or more dielectric, semiconducting, or conducting materials, including, for example, metal, polymer, or ceramic materials, which are formed on the substrate 105. The substrate 105 may comprise, for example, a blank mask comprising a transparent plate of glass or quartz, that is coated with an electron-sensitive resist layer 115 (as shown) and a metal layer; a silicon wafer; a compound semiconductor wafer; a printed circuit board (PCB); or a multichip module (MCM). The substrate 105 comprises an electron-sensitive resist layer 115 having a thickness of from about 20 nm to about 1 m, or even from about 50 to about 500 nm. For example, the resist layer 115 may be a multi-component resist layer having a top imaging layer with a thickness of from about 20 to about 150 nm. The pattern imprinted on the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 may be, for example, a latent image of a mask used in the fabrication of an integrated circuit (IC), display, or printed circuit board (PCB), or a circuit layout of an IC, display, or PCB. For the multi-component resist layer, the latent image can be transferred into lower layers, which themselves are used to further etch the pattern into the substrate 105. For example, one of the lower layers may be a mask absorber, wafer, metal, or dielectric layer. After exposure of a mask to the electron beams 110, the exposed resist layer 115 is developed to form the pattern on the mask. After generation of the pattern on the mask, IC, display, or PCB, the substrate materials are etched to form features such as a stencil mask, electrically interconnecting wiring or vias, or active or passive devices, such as for example, resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. The features may be shaped as, for example, lines, plugs, cavities, channels, holes and trenches. In one version, the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 includes a laser beam section 120 coupled to an electron beam section 125, as shown in FIG. 1. The laser beam section 120, as illustrated in FIG. 2, includes a laser beam generator 130, beam modulator 135, and laser optics 140. The laser beam generator 130 may be a deep ultraviolet (DUV) continuous-wave (CW) laser source in the wavelength range of from about 248 to about 266 nm. In one embodiment, the laser beam generator 130 is a 257 nm argon-ion laser source. In operation, a laser beam 144 is generated by the laser beam generator 130 and split into a plurality of individual laser beams 145 by a beam splitter 150. The beam splitter 150 may comprise, for example, a diffractive optical element, such as a diffraction grating, or a group of one-way mirrors. Typically, the multiple laser beams 145 form an array 155, as shown. The array 155 of laser beams 145 enters the beam modulator 135, where the intensity level of each of the laser beams 145 in the array 155 is individually modulated. For example, the beam modulator 135 may comprise an array of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs), which switch the laser beams 145 on or off by acoustically diffracting the laser beams 145 in response to an RF signal, or set the transmitted photon flux of each individual beam to a predetermined intermediate value. In one embodiment, the laser beam 145 is split into an array 155 of 32 beams by the beam splitter 150 and an equivalent number of beam modulator elements (such as 32 AOMs) are provided. In an AOM array, the modulation of the photon intensity is achieved by applying RF power to the individual AOM channels. Applying different levels of RF power can be used for fine modulation of the laser intensity. In another embodiment, the beam modulator 135 comprises an array of spatial light modulators (SLM) that is adapted to modulate the intensities and spatial extent of the laser beams 145. The SLM array can also serve as the beam splitter 150 or a part of the laser optics 140. The spatial light modulator may comprise a micromechanical diffracting device, cantilevered beam, or deformable mirror array. The SLM array can be advantageous because it can typically modulate a larger number of laser beams 145, such as from about 100 to about 10,000 laser beams 145. A grayscale comprising multiple gray levels and a multiple pass writing strategy may be used. Furthermore, an additional beam modulator (not shown) may be inserted in the optical system upstream of the splitter 150 to act as a fast auxiliary blanker. This additional beam modulator may be used during a scan retrace step for additional modulation. In one illustrative embodiment, a 300 MHz carrier frequency is used to diffract the laser beams 145 with an approximately 10 nsec pixel on-time. The individually modulated laser beams 145, after passing through the beam modulator 135, are demagnified by the laser optics 140. The laser optics 140 may include optical light lenses focused on a desired plane of the electron beam section 125. The laser beam 145 from the laser beam generator 130 may also be actively controlled by automatic beam centering mirrors 160 so that alignment to the optical train, both in position and angle, is maintained. An attenuator 165, which may comprise a combination polarization rotating element and polarizing beam splitter, adjusts the laser power to a range suitable for operation of the system while allowing the laser beam generator 130 to operate in a power range optimized for reliability and stability. A spatial filter 170 can remove undesirable sections of the laser beam's intensity profile. Anamorphic relay optics may be provided to create a round beam from the laser light exiting this aperture and relay it to the beam splitter 150 comprising a diffractive optical element (DOE) 175 inside a brush module 180. The DOE 175 in this exemplary embodiment is a grating that produces a plurality of laser beams 145. For example, the DOE 175 may produce 32 laser beams 145. The laser beams 145 are focused by the lenses inside the brush module 180 to a region in the beam modulator 135. A mechanical shutter 185 before the brush module 180 is used to block light from reaching the electron beam section 125 when the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 is not exposing the substrate 105. A K-mirror 190 allows for rotational adjustment of the linear array of laser beams 145 exiting the additional beam modulator. A wave plate 195 aligns the polarization of the beams 145 for optimal focusing through a subsequent birefringent photocathode substrate that is described below. A lens element 200 after the wave plate 195 focuses the laser beam array 155 onto an afocal spot on a steering mirror 205. Before reaching the steering mirror 205, any zero-order (undiffracted) light from the beam modulator 135 is blocked by a zero-order beam stop 210. The steering mirror 205 allows for small positional adjustment of the spot array at the final image plane of an objective lens 215. The zoom optics and stigmator 220 relay the focal spot into the pupil of the objective lens 215. Tilted plates inside the zoom optics and stigmator 220 provide adjustment capability to ensure that the focus of the spots onto the electron beam section 125 occurs in the same plane whether measured along the direction of the array of spots or perpendicular to it. Movable lenses within the zoom optics and stigmator 220 allow for slight magnification adjustment of the laser beam array 155. Below the laser beam section 120, the electron beam section 125 converts the laser beam image generated by the laser beam section 120 into a corresponding electron beam image. The electron beam section 125 may comprise a vacuum column 225 containing a vacuum environment in which electron beams 110 can be generated to expose the substrate 105 to the electron beam image. The vacuum column 225 comprises walls 230 that are substantially vacuum-tight and are typically made of a material such as aluminum. One or more vacuum pumps (not shown) are provided to evacuate the vacuum column 225 to create and maintain the vacuum environment. In one embodiment, the vacuum pumps provide a first vacuum environment at the top portion of the vacuum column 225, and a second vacuum environment which may have a different vacuum pressure at the bottom portion of the vacuum column 225. For example, the first vacuum environment may be at a gas pressure of about 109 Torr and the second vacuum environment may be at a gas pressure of about 106 Torr. A pressure barrier may also be provided between the vacuum environments to maintain the pressure difference. The electron beam section 125 includes a multiple electron beam source 235, an anode 240, and electron optics 245. In one embodiment, the multiple electron beam source 235, the anode 240 and a portion or all of the electron optics 245 form an electron gun whose elements cooperate to extract, accelerate, and focus the electron beams 110. In the operation of the illustrated version of FIG. 1, the laser optics 140 focus the laser beam array 155 exiting the beam modulator 135 onto a photoemissive layer 250 of a photocathode 255 of the multiple electron beam source 235. The photocathode 255 receives the laser beam image and generates the corresponding electron beam image out of the multiple electron beams 110. The photocathode 255 may additionally comprise a substrate that is transparent to the laser beams 145 as they pass through the substrate to the photoemissive layer 250. In operation, photons absorbed in the photocathode 255 excite electrons above the energy level of the vacuum, and a portion of the electrons that are sufficiently excited are emitted into the vacuum environment. In one embodiment, the photocathode 255 has a photoyield of at least about 20 nA/mW. Examples of suitable photocathodes 255 are CsBr (cesium bromide) photocathodes, CsXTeY (cesium telluride, where X and Y are rational numbers) photocathodes, CsMo photocathodes, Mg (magnesium) photocathodes, negative electron affinity photocathodes, based for example on cesiated GaAs (gallium arsenide), cesiated GaN (gallium nitride) photocathodes, and silicon-cesium oxide nanoclusters and possibly gold with a covering of hydrocarbons. The cesium bromide and cesium telluride photocathodes include a photoemissive layer of cesium bromide and cesium telluride, respectively. Cesium bromide and cesium telluride (Cs2Te) are compound semiconductors with bandgaps in the range of from about 3 to about 5 eV. For example, they can yield a high quantum efficiency (about 10%) when irradiated with deep ultraviolet light having wavelengths of from about 198 to about 365 nm, and produce electrons having an energy spread of from about 1 to about 3 eV. In typical operation, a laser beam 145 in the wavelength range of from about 198 to about 365 nm can be used to illuminate the CsBr or Cs2Te photocathode. Certain embodiments may also include a cesium bromide (CsBr) layer applied to the top of a photocathode structure comprising oriented sapphire and a conducting Mo layer. For example, the CsBr layer may have a thickness of from about 5 to about 20 nm. Exemplary electron optics 245 are shown in greater detail in FIG. 3. The photocathode 255 forms an extraction field between itself and the anode 240 to draw electron beams 110 from the photocathode 255 and accelerate the electron beams 110 toward the substrate 105. For example, the extraction field may have a strength of from about 5 to about 10 kV/mm. The electrons are accelerated to an initial energy level to draw the electrons from the multiple electron beam source 235 and form the electrons into multiple defined electron beams 110. The extraction energy level is selected to be sufficiently high to substantially prevent interactions between the electron beams 110. When the electron beams 110 are moving vertically at a higher velocity, lateral interactions between the electron beams 110 are typically less significant than when the electron beams 110 are moving at lower velocities. In one embodiment, the electron beams 110 have varying individual widths throughout the electron optics 245 with an ultimate resolution of from about 10 to about 100 nanometers. When a voltage is applied between the photocathode 255 and the anode 240, the electrons are accelerated and focused by the electron optics 245 to transfer the multiple laser beam image 166 at the photocathode 255 to a multiple electron beam image 111 at the substrate 105. In one embodiment, the photocathode 255 is biased at about 50 kV, with respect to a grounded anode 240 that is separated from the photocathode 255 by an accelerating gap. The anode 240 is typically a planar metallic electrode with an aperture in the center. Alternatively to the photocathode version, the electron beam source 235 may comprise an array of controlled sized apertures illuminated by an electron gun to generate electron beams 110. The electron gun may comprise, for example, a LaB6 or thermal field emission source to generate electrons. One or more individually addressable electrodes are provided about each of the apertures to draw the electron beams 110 from the electron gun and individually modulate the passage of each electron beam 110. The aperture array may further comprise one or more extraction and focusing electrodes adapted to extract electron beams 110 from the controlled apertures. The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises electron optics 245 to shape the electron beams 110, such as to focus, demagnify, stigmate, or align the electron beams 110. Optionally, an electron field lens 260 is used to reduce distortion and aberrations as the multiple electron beam image is transferred to demagnification lenses 275 that follow. Further details of exemplary electron optics are shown in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,215,128 by Mankos et al., titled A Compact Photoemission Source, Field and Objective Lens Arrangement for High Throughput Electron Beam Lithography, filed on Mar. 18, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The field lens 260 collimates the electrons exiting the accelerating region above the anode 240 and converges the electron beams 110 to at least one crossover, such as in the plane of a beam-limiting aperture 270. As shown, the field lens 260 generates a magnetic field, but it can alternatively comprise an electrostatic lens assembly to generate an electric field. The image created by the field lens 260 is then subsequently demagnified by the demagnification and objective magnetic lenses 275, 280 to form an array 285 of focused electron beams 110. A set of alignment and stigmation coils 290 is used to center and stigmate the electron beam array 285 in the beam-limiting aperture 270 and in the objective lens 280. In one embodiment, a beam scanner 295 comprising a set of magnetic beam deflection coils 297 is used to scan the array 285 of individually modulated electron beams 110 across the substrate 105. Another set of magnetic deflection coils 300 performs dynamic stigmation and focus as the electron beam array 285 is scanned across a field of the substrate 105. This allows dynamic stigmation, focus, or x/y deflection corrections to be applied to different parts of the scan field. The electron beam path traversed by the electron beams 110 can be curvilinear. The orientation of the laser beam section 120 to the electron beam section 125 may be adapted to convenience, for example such that the configuration is suitable to the overall exterior packaging of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100. In one embodiment, the components of the electron beam section 215, such as the multiple electron beam source 235, anode 240, and beam scanner 295, are coaxially aligned in a column above the substrate 105 The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises a substrate support 305 capable of supporting the substrate 105. The support 305 may comprise an electrostatic chuck (not shown) capable of holding the substrate 105 against the support 305, or alternatively a gravity-held kinematic mount (not shown). The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may also comprise support motors capable of moving the support 305 to precisely position the substrate 105 in relation to the electron optics 245 or to move the substrate 105 to translate the electron beams 110 across the substrate 105. For example, the support motors may comprise electric motors that transport the support 305 in the x and y directions along an x-y plane parallel to the substrate surface, rotate the support 305, elevate or lower the support 305, or tilt the support 305. The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may further comprise support position sensors capable of precisely determining the position of the support 305. For example, the support position sensors may operate in conjunction with a substrate height sensor, which reflects a light beam from the substrate 105 and detects the intensity of the reflected beam to precisely determine the actual distance between the substrate 105 and a focal plane of the electron beams 110. In one embodiment, the focal plane of the electron beams 110 is by a vertical position of a fiducial mark locator 340. As the array 285 of electron beams 110 approaches the substrate 105, the electron beams 110 are retarded by a beam retarding system 310 that applies retarding electric potential about the electron beams 110 to decrease the kinetic energy of the electron beams 110 substantially near the substrate 105. The retarding electrical potential is an electrical potential that is lower than the electric potential maintained at a component, such as the anode 240, that precedes the location of application of the retarding potential along the path traversed by the electron beams 110. The retarding electrical potential decreases the kinetic energy of the electron beams 110 to a level that is sufficiently low that the electrons are in a range of desirable landing energies at the time they strike the electron-sensitive resist layer 115 of the substrate 105. The correspondingly lower landing velocities of the electron beams 110 provide better exposure efficiency since lower beam currents can be used while maintaining desirably high resolution levels. The resolution of the exposure pattern formed in the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105 may be similar to conventional higher energy exposures because aberrations due to the retarding process scale down with the decreased final beam energy, and because the electrons that are at a much lower energy level tend to travel shorter distances both through the thickness of the resist layer 115 and sideways into adjacent pixel regions. Also, the lower electron beam current exposes the resist layer 115 more efficiently because the electrons with lower kinetic energies have a larger effective cross-section within the resist layer 115 of the substrate 105. Higher energy electrons tend to penetrate deeper into the resist layer 115 and are delivered in larger doses due to their smaller effective cross-section. Additionally, the lower electron current decreases the amount of space charge interaction between the electron beams 110 to improve the resolution of the electron beams 110 and the quality of pattern generation. Typically, the electron beams 110 are decelerated from their peak kinetic energy, which occurs after acceleration beyond the anode 240. In one embodiment, it is desirable to retard the electron beams 110 to a landing energy of from about 100 eV to about 5 keV. Furthermore, for a multi-component resist layer having a top imaging layer with a thickness of from about 20 to about 150 nm, the proximity effects due to sideways exposure into adjacent pixel regions are reduced. In one version, as shown in FIG. 3, the electron beam retarding system 310 comprises a potential decreasing element 315 held at a lower electric potential than the anode 240, such as a negative potential relative to the potential of the anode, and is located between the anode 240 and the substrate support 305, about or inside the substrate support 305, or below the substrate support 305. The potential decreasing element 315 creates a region of low electric potential above the substrate support 305 such that the electron beams 110 are decelerated. For example, if the multiple electron beam source 235, anode 240, and potential decreasing element 315 are adapted to be at electric potentials VB, VA, and VB+VL, respectively, then VL may be from about 0.1 to about 5 kV. In one embodiment, the anode 240 is grounded and VA is approximately zero. Alternatively or in addition to the range of VL provided above, the ratio of VB to VL may preferably be from about 10 to about 100. In one embodiment, VL is from about 0.5 kV to about 3 kV. By retarding the electron beams 110, beam-to-beam interactions, scattering, and localized heating effects can be reduced while improving one or both of exposure rate and resolution. The electron beam retarding system 310 acts upon electrons emerging from objective magnetic lenses 275, 280 of the column 225, the electrons having a high beam energy EB, such as in the range of from about 10 to about 100 keV, but impinging on the substrate 105 with a retarded landing energy EL, such as from about 0.1 to about 5 keV. For example, the potential decreasing element 315 may be a retarding electrode 320 near the substrate support 305. The retarding electrode 320 may comprise a laterally extended conductor having an aperture 325 therein to allow passage of the electron beams 110 through the aperture 325. The aperture 325 in the retarding electrode 320 may have a diameter of from about 10 to about 1000 times the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) diameter of the electron beams 110 to suitably allow passage of the electron beams 110 therethrough while also effectively retarding the electron beams 110. In one version, the substrate support 305 is adapted to apply a retarding potential to the substrate 105 via a potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305. For example, the substrate support 305 may comprise a retarding electrode 330 that connects to a retarding voltage supply 335 and makes electrical contact with the substrate 105 to maintain the substrate 105 at a desirable electric potential. In one embodiment, the retarding electrode 330 is a conductive pin that passes through a portion of the substrate support 305 and contacts the underside or topside of the substrate 105. The substrate support 305 can be adapted so that the retarding electrode 330 and the substrate 105 are electrically isolated. For example, if the vacuum column 225 is grounded, the substrate 105 should be electrically floated from the vacuum column 225 to ensure that the substrate 105 is held at the appropriate retarding potential by the retarding voltage supply 335. This potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305 may be used by itself or in combination with the potential decreasing element 315 between the anode 240 and the substrate support 305, about the substrate support 305, or below the substrate support 305. When a plurality of potential decreasing elements 315 are used, the retarding potential may be applied in stages. For example, a first potential decreasing element 320 above the substrate support 305 may be maintained at a first retarding voltage Vr1, and a second potential decreasing element 330 in the substrate support 305 may be at a second retarding voltage Vr2 that is lower than the first retarding voltage Vr1, as shown in FIG. 3. This generates two successive potential drop regions that allow the retarding potential to be more gradually stepped, thereby lessening deleterious electric field effects that may be caused by a large potential difference between two adjacent conductors. Vr1 can be further subdivided if the first potential decreasing element 320 comprises a plurality of electrodes, such as an electrostatic Einzel lens, which may ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e symmetric or asymmetric. In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated by the plot of FIG. 4, the electron beams 110 are accelerated in the vacuum column 225 to an energy of about 50 keV before being retarded. In this example, the multiple electron beam source 235 is held at a potential of about 50 kV, other optional optical components below the multiple electron beam source 235 may be at potentials higher than 50 kV, and one optical component farther down, such as the anode 240, may be at a potential of about 0 V. A retarding potential is applied to the potential decreasing element 315 to decelerate the electron beams 110 from an energy of about 50 keV to an energy of about 1 keV. For example, the substrate support 305 may be held at a potential of about 49 kV by the potential decreasing element 315 in the substrate support 305 such that the electron beam 110 decelerates to 1 keV as it approaches the substrate 105. Exposure rate refers to the area of the pattern exposed on the substrate 105 per unit time, and determines the speed of pattern generation. A first factor affecting exposure rate is the total beam current used to pattern the substrate 105. The total beam current is equal to the number of electron beams Nb multiplied by the current Ib delivered by each electron beam 110. The exposure rate R (cm2/sec) of a system is typically equal to the total beam current I (Amps) divided by the resist sensitivity S (C/cm2). Thus, the time Tto expose a given area is approximately AS/NbIb, where A is the area to be patterned. High exposure rates can be achieved by using a sufficiently large number of electron beams 110 and a sufficiently large current in each electron beam 110. However, the retarded electron beams 110 described above can expose more area in a given amount of time since the resist sensitivity S is approximately proportional to the energy of the electron beams 110. Therefore, the total beam current can be decreased while maintaining exposure rate, the advantage being improved resolution. Or, alternatively, exposure rate can be increased while maintaining total beam current at a given resolution. The improved performance allows the use of confined brush optics having one or more crossovers. This substantially increases the operating range of the optics and extends the system performance. Another benefit of the retarding potential configuration is that, due to the low landing energy EL, proximity effects from electron scattering are eliminated or greatly reduced. The reduced landing energy also reduces the incident exposure power, which in turn reduces deleterious heating effects within the substrate 105. A multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 that uses a plurality of electron beams 110 to generate a pattern on a substrate 105 can consequently operate with better resolution, with better dimensional control, and at higher exposure rates than single electron beam pattern generators. First, the total current I=NbIb is divided into a plurality of beams 110 Nb. The spatial separation of the beams 110 helps reduce the space charge interactions within the optics as well as heating effects on the substrate 105. Both factors improve print resolution. The extended spatial extent of the beams 110 also can allow a lower substrate support velocity as the effective field of view is increased, as well as reduce the slew rate of the electronics used to scan the beam array 155. There are other system benefits to using multiple electron beam optics having a single deflection system. The confined brush of the multiple electron beam array can be driven by a raster bitmapped datapath having the capability of handling large pattern files as input to the system. The use of a confined brush array can simplify the calibration of their position and dosage. This multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 can thereby exceed the resolution of conventional pattern generators. Further benefits of the confined brush configuration include maintaining efficient calibration as the number of beams 110 is increased, substrate support yaw, pitch, and roll errors that have an impact on pattern positional accuracy can be greatly reduced compared to extended exposure strategies that have highly separated distances between individual beams 110. The total beam current can be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude, such as a reduction of about 50 times, in comparison to a conventional electron beam pattern generator that does not retard the electron beams 110 while maintaining a good exposure throughput. Space charge interactions between the electron beams 110 are reduced because of these significantly lower beam currents. This improvement may even yield higher throughputs than certain conventional pattern generators, such as throughputs of, for example, at least about 1 wafer per hour for wafers having a diameter of about 300 mm. Moreover, a lower power laser beam generator 130 can be used to generate the lower current electron beams 110. Pixel delivery data rate and optical field of view are other system factors that can be taken into account to meet desired exposure rates. Multiple electron beam patterning permits the use of slower data clocks since the pixel exposure rate is the product of the number of electron beams 110 and the data clock rate. The extended field of the electron beams 110 effectively increases the field of view and thereby reduces the corresponding substrate support velocity for a given exposure rate. In one embodiment, the potential decreasing element 315 and retarding voltage supply 335 are provided in a beam retarding modification kit for a conventional electron beam pattern generator. For example, the retarding electrode 320 can be installed in a conventional electron beam pattern generator to add the capability of retarding multiple electron beams 110. Additionally or alternatively, the substrate support can be modified to include the potential decreasing element 315, or the conventional substrate support can be replaced with an upgraded substrate support 305 that includes the potential decreasing element 315. For example, a retarding electrode 330 provided in the beam retarding modification kit may be embedded in the conventional substrate support and connected to the retarding voltage supply 335 to upgrade the substrate support. Additionally, the substrate support can be modified to electrically isolate the substrate 105 from other parts of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100, such as the vacuum column 225. The beam retarding modification kit provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative to replacement of the entire conventional electron beam pattern generator with an improved multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 having the multiple beam retarding capability described herein. Returning to FIG. 1, the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may further comprise a fiducial mark locator 340 capable of locating fiducial marks (not shown) on the substrate 105. The fiducial marks may be used as reference points of the substrate 105. For example, the fiducial marks of the substrate 105 may be useful for preemptively correcting the pattern to be generated on the substrate 105. Fiducial marks may move relative to their intended locations during processing of the substrate 105. The degree of movement or misalignment of the fiducial marks may vary at different regions of the substrate 105 depending upon the localized stresses or distortions of the substrate 105, or the apparatus that placed the fiducial mark. The multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 further comprises a controller 400 comprising a suitable configuration of hardware and software to operate the components of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 to generate a pattern on the substrate 105. An exemplary controller 400 is illustrated in FIG. 1. For example, the controller 400 may comprise a central processing unit (CPU) 405 that is connected to a memory 410 and other components. The CPU 405 comprises a microprocessor, such as a complex instruction set computer (CISC) microprocessor, for example a Pentium () microprocessor commercially available from Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif., or a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessor, capable of executing a computer-readable program 415. The memory 410 may comprise a computer-readable medium such as hard disks 420 in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) configuration, removable storage 425 such as an optical compact disc (CD) or floppy disk, random access memory (RAM) 430, and/or other types of volatile or non-volatile memory. The interface between a human operator and the controller 400 can be, for example, via a display 435, such as a flat panel display or cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, and an input device, such as a keyboard 440. The controller 400 may also include drive electronics 445 such as analog and digital input/output boards, linear motor driver boards, or stepper motor controller boards. The computer-readable program 415, as shown in FIG. 5, generally comprises software comprising sets of instructions to operate the apparatus components, and an apparatus manager 450 to manage the instruction sets. The computer-readable program 415 can be written in any conventional programming language, such as for example, assembly language, C, C++ or Pascal. Suitable program code is entered into a single file, or multiple files, using a conventional text editor and stored or embodied in the memory 410 of the controller 400. If the entered code text is in a high level language, the code is compiled, and the resultant compiler code is then linked with an object code of pre-compiled library routines. To execute the linked, compiled object code, the user invokes the feature code, causing the CPU 405 to read and execute the code to perform the tasks identified in the computer-readable program 415. Using a keyboard interface, a human user enters commands or registration parameters into the computer-readable program 415 in response to menus or screens displayed on the display 435. The computer-readable program 415 may include instruction sets to, for example, control the positioning of the substrate support 305 (instruction set 455), locate the fiducial marks (instruction set 460), control beam modulation (instruction set 465), control data compression (instruction set 470), and control the retarding of the electron beams 110 (instruction set 473). The instruction sets may receive parameters, such as a data file corresponding to the support position, the fiducial mark locations, the pattern, or instructions entered by the human operator. The controller 400 is adapted to generate, send, and receive signals to operate the apparatus components to generate a pattern on the substrate 105 using electron beams 110. For example, the controller 400 may send signals to the beam modulator 135 to control modulation of the electron beams 110 to the desired intensity levels and in correspondence to the electron beam pattern data. The beam modulator 135 may also be controlled to scale the pattern in the scanning direction by timing the beam pulses, and the support motors may also receive real-time instructions from the controller 400 to control the position of the substrate 105 to scale, rotate, or offset the pattern generated by the electron beams 110 on the substrate 105. As another example, the controller 400 may also operate the fiducial mark locator 340 by receiving measured locations of the fiducial marks and comparing them to their intended locations to determine the deviation of each fiducial mark. The controller 400 may control the beam modulator 135 and beam scanner 295 of the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 to scan the electron beams 110 across the substrate 105 according to a raster method, or alternatively, according to a vector method. Depending on the scanning method used, the pattern data that are stored in the memory 410 and communicated to the beam modulator 135 are also different. FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing a data processing path for a raster scanned electron pattern. In a raster method, the pattern data 475 are processed into a bitmap 480 by a rasterizer 485 and the bitmap 480 is stored in the memory 410. An exemplary rasterizer 485 is described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,533,170 by Teitzel et al., titled Rasterizer for a Pattern Generation Apparatus, filed on Nov. 22,1994, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thereafter, a corrector 490 corrects the bitmap to compensate for proximity exposure effects by making changes in dosage. A sequencer 495 then sequences the bitmap to sequentially apply the bitmap data to the modulation of the individual electron beams 110. Control of pixel dosage is determined by the modulation of the electron beams 110 as a function of time. The electron beams 110 are scanned across the substrate 105 in coordination with the translation of the substrate support 305, and in a substantially predetermined sequence of parallel scan lines to generate the pattern on the substrate 105. In a vector scanning method, in contrast, the pattern data are stored as vectors. For example, data corresponding to a line can be stored as a vector comprising a starting position, a length, and a direction. Additionally, certain other shapes may be stored in a way that refers to the characteristic dimensions of the shapes. The electron beams 110 are scanned across the substrate 105 along paths that correspond to the pattern vectors. For example, to draw a line, the beam scanner 295 could deflect an electron beam 110 to the starting position in a first step, the beam modulator 135 turns on the electron beam 110 in a second step, the beam scanner 295 deflects the turned-on electron beam 110 through the length of the line in a third step, and the beam modulator 135 turns off the electron beam 110 in a fourth step. The electron beams 110 are spatially distributed such that interference and other crosstalk between them are reduced or eliminated. However, a final exposed pattern in the resist layer 115 produced by raster scanning is typically composed of overlapping spots, which can be accomplished by employing an interlaced scan pattern print strategy and writing with multiple passes. FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate an embodiment of such an interlaced raster scanning method. Shown in FIG. 7 is a portion of the leading edge of an electron beam brush 500. More particularly, the first five (5) beams 110 of the brush 500 are shown for clarity. The electron beam brush 500 is scanned in the direction perpendicular to the alignment of the brush 500. By the next scan, the substrate support 305 has moved in the direction of the alignment of the electron beams 110 in the brush 500. In FIG. 8 are shown a plurality of offset brush lines 510 and a single continuous line 520 resulting from the interlacing of the offset brush lines 510. The offset brush lines 510 fill in the continuous line in the y direction while forming lines in the x direction. The controller 400 may contain pattern data in the memory 410 in either flat or hierarchical formats. The flat formats contain the pattern information in a raw form that is not organized by hierarchy or otherwise compressed. For example, the flat formats may comprise MEBES modes 3,4, or 5. In contrast, the hierarchical formats contain the pattern information in a compressed hierarchical organization that expedites storage transmission from the memory 410 to the beam modulator 135. For example, the hierarchical formats may comprise GDS II (a trademark of Calma Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif.). Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with regard to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. The present invention could be used with other multiple electron beam pattern generators 100 or other equivalent configurations as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the multiple electron beam pattern generator 100 may generate a pattern on a substrate 105 using electron beams 110 that are generated and modulated directly by an electron source and that does not use the laser beam section 120. Thus," the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein."""

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a device for actuating a plurality of electric motors in a transportation device, which has a plurality of output stages and a control circuit for actuating these output stages. Each output stage is connected to an electric motor for providing a current for activating the electric motor. The number of electronic components in the transportation device, in particular in motor vehicles, is continuously increasing. The increasing amount of power electronics in each electric motor respectively entails a proportional increase in the costs of the electronics. Because of the high density of electronics within contemporary transportation devices, in particular the retrofitting of electric motors must also be taken into account. Control circuits and power electronics have to be retrofittable for this situation if the means of transportation is to be retrofitted during its long service life. In addition, electric motors in a motor vehicle are often switched on only for a short time and in many cases this precludes the simultaneous operation of another electric motor in parallel. As a result, the multiple arrangement of expensive output stages within one motor vehicle is a waste of existing electronic resources. A wide variety of solutions are already used in motor vehicles for actuating electric motors. Such devices relate to means of transportation such as aircraft, waterborne vessels or motor vehicles. These devices have the following design: a control circuit with a microcomputer or a logic circuit evaluates input data and signals from operator control elements and uses sensor signals to calculate the regulating variables and control variables for the means of transportation. For the actual actuation of the electric motor, output stages are used which connect through or disconnect the power current for the electric motor. Today, such output stages have power breakers in the form of transistors, thyristors or diacs. These power breakers are activated by the control circuit in accordance with the calculated control variables and regulating variables so that the current for the electric motors is connected through or disconnected according to requirements. If the current for the electric motors is connected through, they begin to rotate so that, for example, a seat is actuated and can be moved. In the case of semiconductor switches, a matrix-like arrangement of semiconductors is known which have various semiconductor switches. European Patent EP 240805 A2 discloses a power breaking matrix such as is used in computer technology or in telecommunications. However, there is no consideration here of the generic use for actuating electric motors in means of transportation. German Patent DE 697 05 002 T2 discloses a matrix-like actuation circuit for a plurality of lamps, in each case one output stage is connected to a row line and a column line. As a result, a plurality of lamps can be actuated with relatively few output stages. The actuation circuit is less suitable for actuating electric motors as they can be operated only in one direction if a motor vehicle battery is used for supplying power. German Patent DE 199 10 194 C2 discloses a measuring circuit for a pressure-sensitive resistance matrix using operation measuring amplifiers which are connected to the resistor matrix. However, the circuit is not suitable for actuating electric motors. The object of the present invention is to reduce the number of output stages in order to operate a predefined number of electric motors in both directions of rotation. In addition, when an output stage fails, it is to be possible to actuate the respective electric motor by a further alternative output stage. This object is achieved according to the invention by using a plurality of output stages additionally connected to, in each case, one further electric motor by the control circuit. The control circuit actuates each output stage in such a way that the output stage can actuate either the first or the further electric motor with the output stages being interconnected to one another and/or to the electric motors in the manner of a matrix so that there are a plurality of row lines and a plurality of column lines, at whose points of intersection the electric motors are arranged. Using each row line and each column line, in each case two output stages are connected to power breakers which connect, in accordance with the signals of the control circuit, to a first or a second potential, in particular earth and Ubatt. As a result the actuated electric motor can be operated either in one direction or the other. The output stages each have at least one power breaker and control the power currents in order to actuate electric motors in a means of transportation. Such output stages constitute a high cost factor within the means of transportation and it is then possible, within the scope of the teaching according to the invention, to make a saving by eliminating them because the electric motors which are arranged within a matrix can be actuated in each case by an output stage by means of the row lines and column lines. For example, two to nine electric motors can be connected to an output stage at one row line and this output stage can alternatively actuate a plurality of electric motors. Owing to the lower number of output stages, the expenditure on cooling and the installation space for the output stages within the power electronics is reduced. The power semiconductors are utilized effectively, in particular if, of the electric motors arranged in the matrix, in each case only one electric motor can be operated. Moreover, by virtue of the matrix-like arrangement and the possibility of actuating further electric motors in the matrix, the system can also be enlarged by means of further electric motors after the means of transportation has been delivered. For this purpose, all that is needed for the control circuit is new software which permits the output stage to actuate the additional electric motor. The inventive arrangement of the electric motors within the matrix and the arrangement of the output stages at the end of the row lines or column lines permits the number of output stages to be reduced in comparison with the electric motors to be actuated. Owing to the centralization of the electric motors in matrix form it is possible to construct both the electric motors and the output stages in modular form, i.e. provide them with similar interfaces so that they can be replaced by a further module. Owing to the centralization, the control circuit can be equipped with a more complex power management system for the electric motors as they can then be arranged within one control circuit for all the electric motors. Moreover, the matrix-like structure permits the electric motors and the output stages to be supplied by means of film lines, specifically on the one hand by means of high-current film lines for supplying the electric motors with power and on the other hand by means of low-current film lines for the logic actuation of the output stages by the control circuit. The matrix-like and modular design also makes it easier for failed components to be retrofitted here as all that is necessary is to replace one module in the matrix, and at the same time the interfaces can be respectively standardized. According to the invention, the device is constructed in such a way that in each case two output stages, which connect to a first or a second potential in accordance with the signals of the control circuit, are connected to each row line and each column line. The first potential may be the zero potential, corresponding to the negative pole of the battery in the means of transportation, while the second potential can be the positive battery voltage, for example 12 to 14 volts. If an electric motor of the matrix is then arranged between the first column line of the first row line, the electric motor is driven, for example, in the clockwise direction if the first row line conducts zero potential and the first column line conducts the positive battery potential, while the electric motor is driven in the anticlockwise direction if the first row line conducts the positive battery potential and the first column line conducts the zero potential. Two output stages, one which connects to the zero potential and one which connects to the positive battery potential, are arranged on the first column line. Thus the respective output stage can be actuated in order to make available the corresponding potential for the electric motor. As two output stages are also arranged on the first column line, one output stage can be actuated by the control circuit to connect through to a positive battery potential. If then, for example, the first row line is connected to zero potential, a further electric motor of the matrix can then be actuated in parallel with the first electric motor if the second column line also connects through the corresponding positive potential. For this purpose, the control circuit actuates the corresponding output stage of the second column line so that the latter connects through the supply current for the second electric motor. By virtue of the redundant arrangement of the two output stages per row line or column line it is possible for each of the lines to be connected alternatively to two potentials, respectively permitting the right-handed or left-handed operation of an electric motor. The object of the present invention is, however, also achieved by a device where the electric motors are each arranged between two power supply lines with a plurality of electric motors being connected in each case to a common power supply line, and the respective other power supply connection of these electric motors being connected to different power supply lines. Each power supply line is electrically connected to, in each case, two output stages, the first output stage being connected to a first potential, and the second output stage being connected to a second potential. A circuit breaker is provided between a plurality of electric motors and in each case the assigned power supply circuit in order to prevent parallel currents as a result of electric motors which are not actuated. The device according to the invention reduces the number of output stages for operating the electric motors. The modularization results in improved retrofittability and higher flexibility together with lower costs. Owing to the centralization of the technology, the reliability of the components and of the entire system is improved and, in addition to the reduced expenditure on components and monitoring, it is possible to exchange and replace the individual elements more easily. The device according to the invention provides for the power-electronic output stages to be interconnected to the actuated electric motors by means of a matrix-like structure. The electric motors are arranged here between a first and a second power supply line, which are also referred to as column lines or row lines. The column lines and row lines are laid within the means of transportation and in technical practice not laid linearly and at right angles to one another. The concepts of column lines or row lines indicate however the actuation pattern of a plurality of electric motors through the various column lines and row lines. The electric motors are distributed between a predefined number of row lines m and a certain number of column lines n in such a way that in each case one power supply line is connected to a connection of the electric motor, while the other power supply line is connected to the other connection of the electric motor. For the sake of easy comprehension of the device it is possible to say that the electric motors are connected to the points of intersection between the column line and the row line. In addition, electric motors can also be arranged between two column lines or between two row lines, in which case the column lines which lie next to one another must however always be connected to different potentials so that the electric motor can be operated. For example, when the first electric motor is operating, the first column line is then at zero potential while the second column line is at positive battery potential. A combination is also possible so that individual electric motors are arranged at the points of intersection between column lines and row lines and other electric motors are connected between in each case, two column lines or, in each case, two row lines. The number of power supply lines between the electric motors is reduced as a result of the matrix-like connection of the electric motors. On each supply line, a plurality of electric motors are connected using the power supply connections provided for that purpose. The control circuit is connected to the output stages using, for example, film flat lines or conventional lines in order to provide the actuation current for the output stages. The control circuit may have a microcontroller in which the control algorithms are stored in order to be able to operate them in accordance with the requirements in the means of transportation. This microcontroller may also contain the complete control functions of a control device. As already described, a circuit breaker which helps to avoid parallel currents across the connection matrix is provided within the matrix. The circuit breaker permits an electric motor to be supplied with power by adding the power supply line if the voltage drop across the electric motor, which is caused by the difference in potential between the two power supply lines of the electric motor, is greater than a threshold voltage. The power breaker of the circuit breaker can switch off the flow of current in both directions. This power breaker is intended to prevent the formation of parasitic parallel mass currents across the further electric motors which are arranged within the matrix and not actuated. The circuit breaker prevents the flow of current if there is a series circuit composed of a plurality of electric motors at one row line or one column line. The circuit breaker must operate bidirectionally so that motor currents can permit or disable the left-handed or right-handed rotation of an electric motor. One possible way of implementing the circuit breaker is what is referred to as an electronic diac. The circuit is composed of two power semiconductor switches which are each connected to the connections of the electric motor and whose other end is connected to the column line or row line. Two Schottky diodes which are connected in antiparallel generate a slight drop in voltage across the power breaker if the latter is connected to the on position. Two Zener diodes which are connected in parallel in crisscross fashion set the breakdown voltage to, for example, 6 to 9 volts so that when this breakdown voltage is exceeded the power semiconductor is switched on in order to feed the supply current to the actuated electric motor. If the breakdown voltage at the Zener diode drops below the necessary threshold voltage when an electric motor is not actuated, the circuit breaker switches off and the electric motor is no longer supplied with the corresponding power current. This ensures that only the electric motors which are actuated directly by the control circuit draw current, while the electric motors in parallel branches of the matrix-like electric motor system remain switched off if the actuation voltage, i.e. the difference in potential between the column line and row line is lower than the breakdown voltage. This electronic diac can expediently be applied to circuit boards and film lines or integrated directly into the electric motor. Owing to the matrix-like structure within the device, an error routine can be initiated if the individual power components fail. For this purpose, it is possible to provide, at those output stages which connect to the lower voltage level, a measuring shunt which has the purpose of measuring current. This measured value can be used to monitor the current of the electric motors and can serve as an overload protection for the power breakers. The registration of the measurement signals and the processing of the corresponding evaluation routine which are necessary for this purpose can then be carried out by means of the control circuit which, in the case of an excess current, switches off the respective electric motor and actuates the electric motor via an alternative output stage. In each case two of the output stages may be combined to form what is referred to as a MOSFET half bridge, each of which half bridges are connected to the end of a power supply line. The MOSFET half bridge has, for this purpose, two MOSFET semiconductor power breakers which can be connected through by the control circuit via a corresponding actuation circuit. In order to operate a specific electric motor, the column lines and row lines which are connected to this electric motor must be connected to the potential corresponding to the direction of rotation. In this context, one power breaker of the MOSFET half bridge connects to the zero potential, while the other semiconductor switch of the MOSFET half bridge connects to the positive battery potential. The device according to the invention provides for a matrix-like connection of the electric motors which can each be switched on by a control circuit. The electric motors are operated, for example, by means of the MOSFET half bridges in accordance with the control specifications of the control circuit. The control circuit monitors the power flux within the matrix and performs corresponding error routines if components fail. The circuit breaker in the form of the electronic diac prevents parasitic series connections within the matrix-like interconnection of the electric motors and automatically disconnects non-actuated electric motors from the supply voltage. The device according to the invention has considerable advantages over conventional actuation circuits within a means of transportation. A number of electric motors, predefined by the requirements made of the means of transportation, may be arranged in modular fashion within the described circuit topology and actuated by means of a relatively small number of output stages. 15 electric motors can be actuated by, for example, 6 MOSFET half bridges, which, without the provided switching matrix, would require approximately 30 half bridges with the same function. However, the matrix-like arrangement also permits the number of control outputs of the control circuit to be reduced, as a result of which the number of susceptible contacts is also reduced. The reduced number of power components also reduces the expenditure on cooling. The installation volume and the weight of the control circuits is reduced. This is apparent in particular in the field of motor vehicle seats where today up to 30 electric motors are used. The reduced expenditure on components permits the reliability of the control devices to be increased. The electric motor can also be embodied as a stepping electric motor and have a plurality of connections for power supply lines. In each case earth potential or a predefined positive potential is applied to these connections. For this purpose, the motor is connected in an electrically conductive fashion to a plurality of column lines and the output stages can then connect through the voltage in accordance with the control circuit in each case. The stepping motor can be provided, for example, in vehicle seats for setting the sitting position. There are various possible ways of advantageously configuring and developing the teaching of the present invention. In this respect, reference is made, on the one hand, to the subordinate claims and, on the other, to the following explanation of an embodiment. One embodiment of the device according to the invention is illustrated in the drawing in which, in each case in a schematic representation, Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a circuit diagram of the device according to the invention with electric motors which are arranged in the manner of a matrix and the associated output stages, FIG. 2 is a representation of the technical embodiment with two electric motors and their cabling by means of ribbon conductors according to the present invention, FIG. 3 shows a basic representation of the electric power profile and of the profile of a parasitic parallel current given a matrix-like arrangement of electric motors according to the present invention, and FIG. 4 shows a circuit diagram of a circuit breaker for avoiding parallel currents according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The device for actuating a plurality of electric motors 1 in a means of transportation has a plurality of output stages 2, 3, 4 and 5, the output stages 2, 3, 4, 5 each connecting through the current for activating the electric motors 1. The electric motors 1 are interconnected according to the invention in the manner of a matrix, three electric motors 1 being connected to the row line 6. Three electric motors 1 are likewise connected to the column line 7. The electric motors 1 are interconnected to one another in the manner of a matrix by means of the row and column lines 6 and 7. In each case two output stages 2, 3 are connected in electrically conductive fashion to, in each case, one end of the row lines 6. The output stage 2 connects the row line 6 in each case to earth, while the output stage 3 connects the row line 6 to the positive battery potential Ubatt. Likewise, the output stage 4 connects the column line 7 to earth, while the output stage 5 connects the column line 7 to the positive battery potential Ubatt. At the point of intersection 8, a first electric motor 1 is connected between the row line 6 and a column line 7. If, for example, the column line 7 is connected to 0 volts by the output stage 4, and approximately 12 volts battery voltage Ubatt are applied to the row line 6 via the output stage 3, the electric motor 1 is operated in accordance with its intended function. If the output stage 3 switches off so that the circuit is disconnected, the electric motor 1 is also switched off. By actuating the output stages 2, 3, 4, 5 differently it is possible to switch on and off each electric motor 1 located in the matrix. Owing to the matrix-like arrangement, a smaller number of output stages 2, 3, 4, 5 is necessary in total in comparison with the individual actuation of the electric motors 1. In addition to the arrangement of the electric motors 1 at points of intersection 8, it is also possible to arrange an electric motor 9 between a plurality of column lines 7. The electric motor 9 is switched on if one column line 7 is at zero potential and the other column line is at positive battery potential Ubatt. FIG. 2 illustrates part of the device with two electric motors 1 which are connected to power supply lines 10, each with an output stage circuit board 13 and 14, respectively. In each case two half bridges 11 and 12 are arranged on each of the output stage circuit boards 13, 14, two output stages being integrated in each half bridge 11, 12. The output stage circuit board 13 is connected correspondingly to the individual conductors of the ribbon cable 15, and the output stage circuit board 14 is connected to other conductors of the ribbon cable 15 so that a matrix-like interconnection of the electric motors 1 is produced. FIG. 3 illustrates the current profile 16 when the electric motor 1 is actuated. To do this, the output stage 3 is connected through so that the potential Ubatt is connected to the row line 6, the current at the point of intersection 8 flowing through the electric motor 1 to the column line 7 which is connected via the output stage 4 to the earth potential of the battery of the vehicle. Although all the other output stages are switched off in this exemplary embodiment, a parasitic parallel current 17 may be formed, which flows via the row line 6 and the parallel electric motor 1 to the column line 18 and from there via the parallel electric motor 1 to the row line 19 where the current finally flows back to the column line 7 via the electric motor 1, and from said column line 7 to the zero potential. This parasitic parallel current 17 is an undesired power loss which is prevented by the circuit breaker 20 illustrated in FIG. 4. The circuit breaker 20 which is illustrated in FIG. 4 can be arranged at each electric motor 1 in order to avoid parasitic parallel currents 17. The circuit breaker 20 isolates the electric motor 1 from the supply lines 6, 7 when the electric motor 1 is not actuated by the output stages 2, 3 or 4, 5. However, if the electric motor 1 is actuated by the output stages 2, 3, 4, 5 with an actuation voltage of, for example, 12 volts via the row lines 6 and column lines 7, the actuation voltage exceeds the breakdown threshold voltage of the Zener diode 21, which may be at approximately 6 volts, as a result of which the power breaker 22 is connected through so that the current I can flow through the Schottky diode 23 and the power breaker 22. If the actuation voltage through the output stages 2, 3, 4, 5 is switched off, the Zener diode 21 begins to switch off again, as a result of which the power breaker 22 and the Schottky diode 24, which is connected with opposite polarity, switch off. If the electric motor 1 is operated in the opposite direction in the form of an electric motor, the column line 7 is connected to higher potential, and the row line 6 is connected to zero potential. The breakdown voltage of the Zener diode 25 is exceeded again so that the power semiconductor 26 connects through. The current can then flow in the opposite direction to the first current I through the Schottky diode 24 and the power breaker 26 and in doing so operate the electric motor 1 in the opposite direction. The Schottky diodes 23 and 24 have the positive effect that a particularly low drop in voltage is generated if a high supply current flows through the electric motor 1. The resistors 27 are provided for setting the switching behavior of the circuit breaker 20. The circuit breaker 20 according to the invention is configured in such a way that the assigned electric motor 1 is isolated from the supply current if it is not actuated directly via the output stages 2, 3, 4 and 5. As a result, parasitic parallel currents 17 are prevented. The foregoing disclosure has been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting. Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field of the Invention The invention relates to a motor vehicle door lock with an electromechanical central locking system drive. 2. Description of Related Art A conventional motor vehicle door lock of the type under consideration, therefore the lock for a motor vehicle side door, a rear hatch or a rear door, but also for a sliding door of a motor vehicle, generally has locking elements, such as a latch and ratchet, and a lock mechanism with various levers which are used for actuation. In particular, reference can be made to the prior art (for example, published German Patent Application DE 100 06 765 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,578). Motor vehicle door locks with an electromechanical central locking system drive (for example, German Patent Application DE 100 06 765 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,578) are common. It generally drives a mechanical central locking system element of the lock mechanism in order to move the motor vehicle door lock, overall, at least into a unlocked position, in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the inside and outside, and into a locked position in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the inside, but cannot be opened from the outside. Often, a third position is also set up, specifically an antitheft position, in which the motor vehicle door cannot be opened either from the outside or from the inside. Finally, on the rear side doors and on the rear doors, there can also be a child safety position in which the motor vehicle door can be opened from the outside, but not from the inside. The details in this respect are not important to the teaching of this invention, which relates to the control of the electromechanical central locking system drive. The known motor vehicle door lock underlying the invention (German Patent Application DE 33 39 479 A1 and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,578), first of all, has an electromechanical central locking system drive and a mechanical central locking system element driven by it, in the form of a central locking system drive lever. In this prior art, the central locking system drive encompasses an electric drive motor, a linkage with a gearwheel which forms the driven element, and driver journal which is located on the gearwheel and via which the central locking system element which is made as a pivot lever can be pivoted back and forth between two positions, the unlocked position and the locked position. The construction here is such that the central locking system element with the electric drive motor switched off is decoupled from the drive motor and can be mechanically moved free of resistance from one position into another, for example by actuating a closing cylinder. This motor vehicle door lock has an electronic motor control. The latter encompasses a motor state sensor in the form of a motor current sensor which measures the current drawn by the electric drive motor. The motor control is designed such that it directly triggers or automatically triggers the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locking position either after receiving an actuation signal from an actuation unit such as a closing cylinder, a locking button, a remote control receiving unit or a handle (inside door handle, outside door handle), as soon as a certain operating state of the motor vehicle has been reached. The latter, of course, requires an actuation signal, which is not initiated by an operator, but it is automatically initiated when a certain operating state of the motor vehicle is reached. Such an operating state is, for example, a certain minimum speed of the motor vehicle after being parked beforehand. This function of the known motor vehicle door lock is used to protect passengers against hold-ups at traffic lights or the like. When the operator has climbed into the vehicle, has started the engine and has set off, all door locks of the motor vehicle are automatically locked when a minimum speed of the motor vehicle is exceeded and they remain locked until the operator climbs out again. In the known motor vehicle door lock explained above, the motor control can do something else, for example it can turn off the electric drive motor when the locked position (or the unlocked position) is reached. Here it is provided specifically that to turn off the electric drive motor there is at least one stop which blocks further rotation of the electric drive motor. The motor control is designed such that the electric drive motor is turned off at least when the locked position is reached according to the signal of the motor state sensor. In the motor current sensor which is known in the prior art, this means that the power consumption of the electric drive motor is monitored and the electric drive motor is turned off when a certain boundary value of the motor current is exceeded beyond a certain time. This is evaluated in the motor control as blocking of the motor by the central locking system element or the stop, then the electric drive motor is turned off. This is called blocking operation of the electric drive motor. This makes it possible to abandon microswitches which sense certain positions of the electric drive motor of the step-down gearing, generally downstream of it and/or of the mechanical central locking system element. This saves money and reduces fault susceptibility of the motor vehicle door lock. In practice, it has been shown that in motor vehicle door locks with electromechanical central locking system drives with automatic locking as a result of reaching a defined operating state of the motor vehicle, the noise of the central locking system drive when being turned off is perceived as disturbing. This applies when the turning-off takes place by means of microswitches because the lock mechanism is also stopped suddenly in this case. This applies to a special degree in blocking operation of the electric drive motor because a mechanical element strikes a stop in some form and is thus stopped. Very similar disturbing noise occurs when the electric drive motor, after receiving an actuation signal from the actuation unit, is to a certain extent deliberately stopped by the operator. However, in this case, this noise is perceived as less disturbing because the operator is more or less prepared for it. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to improve the motor vehicle door lock explained in detail above with respect to noise formation. The aforementioned object is achieved by a motor vehicle door lock with a central locking system drive having an electric drive motor and a motor control with a motor state sensor, and a central locking system element that can be moved by the central locking system drive at least into a locked position and the motor control being designed such that it triggers the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locked position after receiving an actuation signal from an actuation unit, such as a closing cylinder, a locking button, a remote control receiving unit or a handle (inside door handle, outside door handle), by the motor control having a control circuit which includes the motor state sensor and that is designed such that, when the electric drive motor is triggered, the electric drive motor runs with low rpm and is controlled using the signal of the motor state sensor to these rpm. The motor control which is present anyway is used in accordance with the invention to control the rpm of the electric drive motor. Thus, it is possible to have the electric drive motor, as a whole, run much more slowly than previously conventional. A more slowly running electric drive motor does lead to slower reaction of the mechanisms of the motor vehicle door lock, but enjoys a series of major advantages. First, there is optimum rpm matching over the entire path of motion of the central locking system element. Unnecessarily high acceleration forces are avoided on the levers of the lock mechanism. The slow running speed of the central locking system drive leads to a reduction of noise formation. The blocking operation of the electric drive motor can be easily integrated into the control circuit, and the blocking current can be additionally limited. In particular, in a digital control circuit this function can be accomplished essentially without additional cost, simply in the programming of a microcomputer. A standard central locking system drive in a conventional motor vehicle is designed for the usual vehicle voltage, in Europe generally 12 V, but it must also work properly with a lower voltage, for example, 9 V at 85 C., but of course also with an overvoltage, for example, 16 V. Proper operation is defined as the counterforces which engage a lever apparatus moved by the central locking system drive as far as the inside safety button having to be overcome. In other words, this means that, in the normal case, the central locking system drive inherently works too quickly and powerfully and especially travels into the block. The central locking system drive according to the invention is moved with a much lower voltage, for example, a voltage of 3 V. With this lower voltage, the central locking system drive, of course, does not have the torque necessary for overcoming additional counterforces. The control of the rpm of the electric drive motor provided in accordance with the invention now leads to the power supply voltage increasing in reaction to the load and when the load is removed, it is reduced again. Overall, the central locking system drive thus runs more slowly and less powerfully, but for this reason much more quietly. The teaching of the invention is of special importance for automatic triggering of the electric drive motor for driving the central locking system element into the locked position as soon as a certain operating state of the motor vehicle has been reached, the control circuit being designed such that after reaching a certain operating state of the motor vehicle, the electric drive motor runs at an rpm which is much lower as compared to the normal triggering of the electric drive motor after receiving an actuating signal, and is controlled to these lower rpm using the signal of the motor state sensor. It is particularly useful when the certain operating state is a certain driving speed being reached after initial starting or restarting of the motor vehicle. In this case, the slower reaction of the mechanism is not perceived as disturbing because, with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor, the operator does not perceive the passage of time anyway. That is, the operator perceives positively only that the motor vehicle door lock is working very quietly because the rpm is so low and therefore the inevitable impact noise is reduced to a minimum. The above described control can always be activated. However, occasionally this can be a disadvantage because the slower reaction of the mechanism is perceived as disturbing. In this case, it can be provided that this control is only activated when the motor control automatically triggers the electric drive motor. When the electric drive motor is triggered after receiving an actuation signal, it remains in this case in the classical, relatively noisy functioning of the motor vehicle door lock. This is perceived quite positively by the operator because he acquires an acoustic report with respect to the function of the motor vehicle door lock. The control which has been described above for automatic actuation of the electric drive motor can also be selectively actuated when the electric drive motor is manually triggered from the interior of the motor vehicle, for example, with the locking button for general locking of the motor vehicle or with a locking button or the like for triggering the child safety. Within the motor vehicle, specifically also for manual triggering, the noise development of the motor vehicle door lock is perceived as stronger than from the outside. Accordingly, it is perceived as comfortable and pleasant even if, in this case, the operation of the central locking system drive is quiet. For the invention described here, the use of a motor current sensor is recommended as the motor state sensor of the motor vehicle door lock, because such a motor current sensor for a direct current motor which is used conventionally in a motor vehicle constitutes an economical sensor element. Fundamentally, other sensors can also be used, for example, an rpm sensor (rotary transducer, pulse counter; magnetic or optical sensor). A torque sensor (especially a mechanical-electrical sensor such as a strain gauge) would also be suitable solely for the shutoff function of the motor vehicle door lock. Overall, circuits which are known from the prior art for these purposes, especially analog control circuits or digital control circuits, are suited for the configuration of the motor control in itself. For this purpose, reference should be made to the technical literature in this regard (see, for example, Tietze, Schenck Semiconductor Circuitry, 10th edition, Springer, Berlin, 1993, especially Chapter 18 Power Supply, especially 18.3 Linear Voltage Regulators, and Chapter 27 Electronic Controllers). Embodiments are explained in the special part of the specification (description of the figures). The invention is explained in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings which show a preferred embodiment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the drawings, the sole FIGURE shows the operating principle of the invention in the manner of an operating diagram. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Some explanations to which reference should be made here can be found in the Background part of the specification pertaining to the basic structure of a motor vehicle door lock with a central locking system drive, to which the teaching of this invention relates. The teaching of the invention relates to a motor vehicle door lock with an electromechanical central locking system drive 1 and a mechanical central locking system element 2 which is driven by it. In the embodiment shown in the FIGURE, the central locking system drive 1 has an electric drive motor 3 which drives the mechanical central locking system element 2, which is made here as a pivot lever, via a step-down gear, which is made here as toothed gearing 4. There are a host of other structures for electric drive motors 3 with step-down gearing 4, for example, a worm gear pair, spur/bevel wheel gear, and partially coupled to it, spindle/spindle nut gear. Reference should be made to the prior art in this regard, which provides a host of alternatives here. Furthermore, an important prerequisite for the invention is that the central locking system drive 1 has a motor control 5. The motor control 5 in the FIGURE is connected to the DC voltage of the vehicle electrical network VN as represented at the power supply terminals 7 on the left, and also controls the turning on and off of the rpm of the electric drive motor 3, according to the invention. Part of the motor control is a motor state sensor 6. It is made, in this example, as a motor current sensor, specifically as a sensor resistor. The central locking system element 2 can be moved at least in the locked position shown in the FIGURE by the central locking system drive 1; in this embodiment, by a gear wheel 4 a of the step-down gearing 4. Basically, it is possible to have the central locking system drive 1 operate in one direction and even operate such that only the locked position is ever started by the central locking system drive 1. The unlocked position could then be only mechanically started. Normally, it is such that the central locking system drive 1 moves the central locking system element 2 not only into the locked position, but also in the unlocked position, in any case, for motor vehicle door locks which are not activated directly by a handle. This embodiment shows such a reversibly operating central locking system drive 1. Finally, there are central locking system drives which can actuate three positions, specifically, the unlocked position, the locked position, and the antitheft position, likewise also a child safety position. However, it is only of importance for the invention that the central locking system drive 1 can actuate at least the locked position. The motor control 5 is designed such that it triggers the electric drive motor 3 for driving the central locking system element 2 into the locked position after receiving an actuating signal from an actuation unit, such as a closing cylinder, a locking button, a remote control receiving unit (outside door handle, inside door handle). Furthermore, the motor control 5 is designed such that it also automatically triggers the electric drive motor 3 as soon as a certain operating state of the motor vehicle has been reached. A certain operating state can be defined, for example, as the state in which airbag sensors have established individuals in all places in the vehicle. In particular, reaching a certain driving speed after one-time or repeated starting of the motor vehicle is defined as one such certain operating state. This is a function which modern motor vehicle door locks increasingly have for reasons of safety, protection from hold-ups at traffic lights or the like. Often nowadays, a motor control 5 is implemented in an integrated circuit, especially a microcomputer, so that the design of the motor control 5 means essentially its suitable programming. The FIGURE shows that the motor control 5 has a control circuit including the motor state sensor 6 and this control circuit is designed such that when the electric drive motor 3 is triggered, the electric drive motor 3 runs with a low rpm and is controlled using the signal of the motor state sensor 6 to this rpm. In particular, reference should be made here to the above described explanation of the preferred construction and the control circuit in the Summary of the Invention portion of this application. It is especially preferable, and in this embodiment it is also implemented, that the control circuit is designed such that, with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor 3 after reaching a certain operating state of the motor vehicle, especially a certain driving speed of the motor vehicle, the electric drive motor 3 runs at an rpm which that is significantly reduced as compared to the normal triggering of the electric drive motor 3 after receiving an actuating signal, and that the motor is controlled to these lower rpm using the signal of the motor state sensor. The motor control 5 shows the microcomputer 8 which centrally organizes all control functions of the motor control 5. On the input side, on the one hand, a speed sensor 9 for determining the respective vehicle speed, on the other hand, at least one actuating sensor 10 for detecting an actuation signal by the actuating unit as explained above, here shown as a radio remote control 10 a, are connected to the microcomputer 8. The microcomputer 8, therefore, on the one hand, receives an input signal which allows the microcomputer 8 to ascertain that a certain operating state of the motor vehicle has been reached, in this embodiment that a certain driving speed of the vehicle has been reached, and on the other hand, an actuation signal which indicates active actuation by an operator. In this connection, it should also be pointed out that reducing the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 of the central locking system drive 1 can also be practical or can be perceived as pleasant with manual triggering from the interior of the motor vehicle, for example, when the inside locking button or the actuating means for the child safety on the rear side doors is actuated. This has already been addressed above. Furthermore, the microcomputer 8 has a measurement input 11, which is connected to the motor state sensor 6, here the motor current sensor (resistor). The outputs of the microcomputer 8 are connected to two motor changeover switches 12 which make it possible to drive the electric drive motor 3 in two directions of rotation. By reversing the polarity of the terminals 13 of the electric drive motor 3 by means of the motor changeover switch 12, one direction of rotation or the other can be stipulated, or when the motor changeover switches 12 are connected opposite one another, a short circuit of the terminals 13 for purposes of high-speed braking of the electric drive motor 3 can be induced. If there is one electric drive motor 3 with only one direction of rotation, these motor changeover switches are of course not required, and a normal on/off switch can be used. It goes without saying that the motor changeover switches 12 will preferably be electronic switches (for example, transistor or thyristor switches), as can also be integrated into the overall circuit arrangement of the microcomputer 8 or on a corresponding board. Basically of course, electromechanical switches cannot be connected. The use of the control circuit of the motor control 5, here, by means of the microcomputer 8, makes it possible to control the electric drive motor 3 with automatic triggering, for example, as a result of the signal of the speed sensor 9, to an rpm which is minimum with respect to the instantaneous operating states. In this embodiment, the microcomputer 8 is programmed such that this takes place basically only with automatic triggering, although it would also be fundamentally possible quite generally to operate the electric drive motor 3 accordingly rpm-controlled. Basically, it would be possible to directly detect the rpm of the electric drive motor 3, for example, by means of a rpm sensor on the driven shaft of the electric drive motor 3. These sensors are known from the prior art as rotary transducers, pulse counters, etc. In particular, optoelectronic rpm sensors are also available. In any case, this embodiment shows a motor current sensor as a motor state sensor 6, an especially economical and reliable approach. In the operating state described here, the central locking system drive 1 will be run with minimum rpm from the starting point to the end stop of the locked position, shown in the FIGURE. Rpm changes of the electric drive motor 3 which occur during this motion, due to fluctuations of the torque which is to be applied by the electric drive motor 3, are equalized by the microcomputer 8 by controlling the power supply voltage of the electric drive motor 3. If the torque on the driven shaft of the electric drive motor 3 increases, the current drawn by the electric drive motor 3 increases. The voltage drop on the internal resistor of the electric drive motor 3 increases, the induced voltage drops and the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 drops back. Accordingly, the reaction is the reverse when the torque which is to be applied by the electric drive motor 3 is reduced. The circuit shown in the FIGURE ascertains, via the motor state sensor 6 in the form of a measurement resistor, the voltage drop which is proportional to the motor current and which is evaluated by the microcomputer 8. If the voltage drop increases, the microcomputer accordingly raises the power supply voltage of the electric drive motor 3 until the desired rpm of the electric drive motor 6 has been reached again. In this way, the rpm of the electric drive motor 3 can be reduced to near the minimum possible rpm which, of course, should always be reached, so that the electric drive motor 3 in the meantime does not stop suddenly and hang up. This results in the displacement of the central locking system element 2 with automatic triggering of the electric drive motor 3 taking place as slowly as possible. In this way, the noise development of the central locking system drive 3 with the central locking system element 2 is minimized. The operator who is sitting in the vehicle does not acoustically notice after the vehicle is started that the motor vehicle door locks are closing with the electromechanical central locking system. At least the operator sitting in the vehicle perceives the closing of the electromechanical central locking system as especially quiet. The corresponding also applies when locking takes place manually from the inside. Likewise, this also applies to unlocking from inside the vehicle. Overall control can be exercised such that only actuations by the operator from the outside initiate the normal, acoustically intensive operating mode of the central locking system, but automatic triggering and triggering by actuation of the interior always result in the controlled operating mode of the central locking system. In the normal case, therefore, for actuation by the operator and when the actuation signal is received by the actuating sensor 10, the microcomputer 8 can trigger the electric drive motor 3 with a higher rpm so that the noise development is greater. For the operator this means the desired acoustic report that his actuation has been successful. This embodiment of the motor control 5 can also be used especially favorably when there is at least one stop 14 which blocks additional rotation of the electric drive motor 3 to turn off the electric drive motor 3. Here then, specifically, the motor control 5 can be designed such that the electric drive motor 3 is turned off at least when the locked position is reached according to the signal of the motor state sensor 6. Thus, without further cost, blocking operation of the central locking system drive 1 can be integrated by circuitry. In this embodiment, the stop 14 is itself specified by a stop surface on the central locking system element 2, against which a journal on the gear wheel 4 a of the step-down gear 4 moves, as is shown in the FIGURE. This is a technology which is known from DE 44 39 479 A1, and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,578 or also U.S. Pat. No. 4,793,640 A. Examples of control circuits can be found in the technical literature, for example, in the Tietze, Schenck citation which is mentioned in the Background part of the specification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No. 60/228,530 filed Aug. 28, 2000. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a position detection and anti-pinch system for a power window of a vehicle and more particularly to a position detection and anti-pinch system and method for detecting the position of a window in a vehicle door assembly. 2. Background Art Door assemblies for automotive vehicles generally include a metal door frame attached to the body of a vehicle. The door frame generally includes inner and outer door frame panels joined about a common edge and a door sill running along top edge of the door to define a window frame. The window frame includes an opening or channel extending through the door frame to receive a window pane. A reinforcement panel may be attached to the inner door panel to provide additional structural support for the door frame and to receive various hardware components. Hardware components such as a handle assembly, window regulator and motor assembly, and electrical components such as interior lights and speakers, are secured to the reinforcement panel concurrently with assembly of the vehicle door. Certain vehicle door assemblies include automatic vehicle window adjustment having a one-touch up feature. The one-touch up feature allows a passenger to raise the window pane with a single touch of a control button on the vehicle door. When actuated, the switch activates a motor assembly operatively connected to a window regulator, causing the window regulator to move the window pane upward toward the top of the window frame to a fully closed position without additional operator intervention. Of particular concern with such one-touch systems is that the passenger may not be able to stop the upward travel of the window pane if an object or an appendage of a person becomes pinched or trapped between the moving window and the window frame, which may lead to significant bodily harm. Several types of obstruction detection systems have been proposed for vehicle door assemblies. One known obstruction detection system includes a control module which senses current spikes in the window drive motor or pressure on the window which would indicate an obstruction being pinched between the upward moving window and the window frame. The obstruction detection system stops and/or reverses the motor upon sensing the current spike or increased pressure while raising the motor. The problem with this design is that an object must be trapped or pinched with sufficient force for the system to sense the need to reverse the motor and lower the window, causing undesirable injury to an occupant prior to the lowering of the window. Further, the sensor is mounted adjacent the motor rather than the window pane, which does not provide an accurate measurement if an object becomes trapped between the window and window pane. Another known obstruction detection or anti-pinch system includes a window seal with a gasket having varying resistivity based upon its level of compression. For example, if an obstruction is pinched between the window and the window frame, the gasket is locally compressed, which alters the resistivity of the gasket. A low current is applied through the gasket, and the variation in resistivity may be sensed to determine the existence of the obstruction, at which point upward movement of the window would be stopped. The system is not particularly desirable because the resistive gasket and associated electronics may be costly and injury may still occur prior to the lowering of the window. Generally, it is known in window control designs to determine the velocity of a power window via pulses from the rotation of a motor's shaft. These pulses are generated by Hall sensors (magnetic sensing), CPD (commutator pulse detection) or switches that provide an open or closed circuit as the motor spins. To coordinate a system to detect information about a moving power windowpane, a supplier must change the system that they are designing to accept these pulses. Control algorithms must then be used to determine the velocity and position of the windowpane based on the received the pulse information. This task is especially critical when considering safety standards like FMVSS 118, where an obstacle must be detected during an auto-up function before a predetermined force is exerted on the window as a result of an obstruction in the path of the power window. With such stringent guidelines, the control system in such motor pulse generating arrangements must learn the characteristics of not only the motor, but the regulator, grease and all of the mechanical linkages between the motor and the window. The system must also be able to accommodate temperature variation and different road conditions into the control process. All of these factors must be considered to provide flawless auto-up operations. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved window position detection and anti-pinch system for an automatic power window of a vehicle. It is also desirable to provide a window position detection system incorporating an anti-pinch detection system which prevents an obstruction from becoming trapped or lodged between a window and a window frame of the vehicle door. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the above-referenced shortcomings of prior art obstruction detection systems by providing a window position detection and anti-pinch system and method for detecting the presence of an obstruction between a window and window frame of a door assembly of a vehicle. The system includes at least one sensing device disposed adjacent the window for detecting the position of the window relative to the window frame. The at least one sensing device monitors the position of the window and generates an output representative of the detected position of the window relative to the window frame A controller is in communication with and is responsive to the output generated by the at least one sensing device. The controller compares the window position output signals generated by the at least one sensing device against predetermined values to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window and window frame. The controller will generate a control signal to stop and reverse the travel of the window upon detection of an obstruction between the window and window frame.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) Referring now to the Figures, a description of the window position detection system of the present invention is discussed in greater detail. A vehicle door assembly 10 includes a vehicle door frame 12 having an outer door panel 14 and an inner door panel 16. Inner and outer door panels 14, 16 are generally vertical panels formed of a stamped sheet metal which are joined to form vehicle door frame 12. Alternatively, vehicle door frame 12 may be formed as a one piece structure. The vehicle door frame 12 includes a header section 18 having a door sill 20 defining a opening 21 in a window frame 28. An passage or channel 22 is provided in a bottom surface of window frame 28 and communicates with the inner periphery between inner and outer door panels 14, 16 in vehicle door frame 12. A handle 24 is mounted in the outer door panel 14. Door assembly 10 may include a structural member or carrier (not shown) mounted to the inner door panel 14 to provide structural support for the vehicle door frame 12 and to receive a plurality of components. Alternatively, the interior vehicle components may be directly secured to the door frame 12. A window carrier assembly is mounted to the carrier on door frame 12 to receive and support a window pane 26. Window carrier assembly generally includes a window regulator and a motor operatively connected to the window regulator to vertically adjust window pane 26. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, window pane 26 is secured to a generally horizontal support arm of the window regulator extending between a pair of generally vertical spaced apart rails. The support arm is set in a track extending through each of the vertical rails of the window regulator. A pair of cables operatively connected to the motor raise and lower the support arm to adjust the vertical position of window pane 26. The window pane 26 moves vertically through the window frame 28 in the spaced apart vertical rails towards the header section 18 and door sill 20 of door frame 12. A seal extends through the inner periphery of a cavity in window frame 28 to receive the upper edges 30, 32 of window pane 26. The seal, which is preferably formed of rubber or other polymeric material, ensures a waterproof and soundproof seal for the interior passenger compartment of the vehicle by sealing the upper edges 30, 32 of window pane 26 and the inner periphery 34 of window frame 28 respectively. Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, a first embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system of the present invention is discussed in greater detail. Window position detection system 36 includes a window 26 operatively connected to a reversible motor 38, an optical or magnetic coding arrangement 40 disposed on a side or edge of the window 26, and an optical or magnetic sensing device 42. As is best seen in FIG. 3, sensing device 42 is coupled to a microprocessor or controller, represented schematically by block 44, through wires 46. Alternatively, sensing device 42 may be in wireless communication with controller 44 via an RF transmitter and receiver or other wireless communication devices. A switch, represented schematically by block 48, is actuated by a passenger of a vehicle to raise or lower the window pane 26 in door assembly 10. The actuation of switch 48 causes controller 44 to send a signal to motor 38 to raise or lower window 26. In accordance with the first embodiment of the invention, coding arrangement 40 can be etched into the window during manufacture, or put on a media 50, shown in FIG. 3, that is applied/adhered to the window pane 26 during assembly of the vehicle. The coding forms a series of binary digits, i.e., ones and zeros, represented schematically by 52 and 54 respectively, that are evenly spaced and correlated with window position so as to convey the vertical position of the window to the microprocessor/controller 44. Such correlation can be carried out via an initial learning process that allows individual identification of a particular vehicle's closed window, i.e., all the way up, and open window, i.e., all the way down, positions. This process can be performed, for example, as part of the vehicle assembly process. After the initial learning phase is completed, the controller 44 of system 36 will utilize the learned boundaries as a reference base for position sensing of the window 26. The boundaries would only need to be reset if the physical parts of the system somehow become misaligned. Such a process advantageously provides a manufacturing plant a simple process of applying the coding to the window that is independent of the car manufacturer. In other words, the system can be put on any platform without concern of window or motor suppliers as long as the initial learning process occurs. Sensing device 42 of window position detection system 36 is provided adjacent coding arrangement 40 on window 26. In an exemplary embodiment, sensing device 42 generally includes a sensor, such as a magnetic field type sensor or an optical (infrared) sensor, and a transmitter for generating output signals based on input detected by the sensor. Sensing device 42 is preferably mounted in the inner periphery of the vehicle door frame 12 between inner and outer door panels 14, 16 adjacent the passage 22 in the bottom edge of window frame 28 and an outer edge of window 26. In operation, as the window pane 26 moves upward in door assembly 10, sensor of sensing device 42 measures and receives high and low input signals corresponding to the digital coding 40 on window pane 26. Coding 40 is binary and is disposed a known distance apart. The transmitter of sensing device 42 generates signal interrupts or outputs based on sensor measurements representative of the window position relative to the window frame and transmits the measured signals to controller 44. Controller 44 is responsive to the output signals generated by the sensing device 42, to determine the vertical position of the window pane 26 relative to the window frame 28. Alternatively, controller 44 may compare output signals generated by sensing device 42 against predetermined values to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window and window frame. It is also understood that other sensor output arrangements may be employed with sensing device 42 and controller 44 of system 36. Window position detection system 36 additionally operates as an anti-pinch system for vehicle door assembly 10. This feature is especially helpful when incorporated into a system having a one-touch-up type operation, i.e., a system that allows a window to be closed or opened by a single actuation of a button or switch. Window position detection system 36 includes a self checking option incorporated in controller 44. Coding 40 provides static position detection measurements to controller 44. Controller 44 monitors the output signals generated by sensing device 42 to detect vertical position of the window 26 relative to window frame 28. The controller 44 additionally compares the window position against predetermined values to detect the presence of an obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28. Since controller 44 knows what value to expect next during the upward or downward travel of window pane 26, the controller 44 can detect a system error when the expected value is not received, or not received within a particular time period corresponding to the expected velocity of the window 26. If such a condition is detected, controller 44 can generate an alert signal to warn the occupant of the vehicle to check the window 26 in door assembly 10. The self-checking feature of controller 44 can be used to stop automatic operation of the window 26 if an error is detected. In operation, coding arrangement 40 of system 36, in addition to sensing static window position, allows controller 44 to detect the presence of obstructions between to upper edges 30, 32 of window pane 26 and window frame 28. The microprocessor/controller 44 detects any change in the velocity of travel of the window pane 26 in the door assembly 10 to determine the presence of an obstruction. Since the system can determine the position and velocity of the window 26, system 36 can sense the presence of an obstacle in the window path by detecting a decrease in velocity at a certain window position. If such a condition is detected, the controller 44 can initiate a control sequence, transmitting a signal to motor 38 to stop and/or reverse the travel of the window 26 in window frame 28. Referring now to FIGS. 4-6, a second embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system of vehicle door assembly 10 of the present invention is disclosed. The second embodiment of window position detection system, generally referenced by numeral 56, provides an anti-pinch arrangement for detecting obstacles during the upward travel of a window pane 26 during a one-touch-up operation. System 56 includes two redundant detection methods to determine whether or not an obstacle is in the way of a moving power window 26. A transmitter 58 is recessed into a top rear portion of the door frame 12 below header section 18 to a monitor the opening 22 of window frame 28. Transmitter 58 sends a energy signal 60, such as directed infrared light, or an ultrasound wave, along inner periphery 34 of the window frame adjacent the upper portion of window frame 28. Transmitter 58 is designed to emit ac signal that is laser thin so as to be unnoticeable to the operator and that is coded and sufficiently filtered to attenuate sunlight or other ambient light. The signal 60 generated by transmitter 58 follows the linear outline of the window frame 28 bent via a prism 62 at a change in angle of the door frame 12. Prism 62 is positioned in the path of signal 60 and is arranged to redirect signal 60 along the edge of window frame 28 adjacent door sill 20 toward a receiver 64. Receiver 64 is adapted to detect any variation in the transmission of electromagnetic energy signal 60 from the transmitter 58. Alternatively, fiber optics could be used to send and receive infrared light, and communicate with the controller 44. As is shown in FIG. 6, prism 62 may additionally include a shutter 66 arranged to block the energy signal 60 entering prism 62 if an obstruction contacts a lower end of shutter 66. If an obstacle intrudes into the area of interest near the bottom of the prism 62, springs 68 will compress, forcing the prism 62 upward in the housing 67 over the prism lens 70, thereby breaking the energy signal 60 between the transmitter 58 and receiver 64. The transmitter 58, prism 62 and receiver 64 monitor a distinct area of the passage 22 in window frame 28 between the upper edges 30, 32 of window 26 and the inner surfaces of window frame 28. Controller 44 is in communication with the transmitter 58 and receiver 64 by wires 72 to generate and process the signals detected. Controller 44 terminates the upward travel of the window pane 26 by generating a signal to stop and/or reverse motor 38 if an obstruction is detected between the window pane 26 and window frame 28 which breaks the continuity of the transmission. It is understood that transmitter 58, prism 62 and receiver 64 can be used with a variety of geometries of window frames 28 provided in vehicle door assemblies. The second, redundant detection method is provided via a coding 74 on the window 26. In a preferred embodiment, coding 74 is provided on the window adjacent a portion extending within the window frame 28 of door assembly 10 such that the coding is unnoticeable to the passengers of the vehicle. Coding 74 allows the controller 44 through sensing devices 76, 78, to monitor the velocity and position of the window 26 during the upward travel of the window relative to window frame 28 of door assembly 10. As best seen in FIG. 5, the coding 74 is measured via an infrared reflection arrangement 76, an infrared transmission arrangement 78, such as a suitable transmitter 80 and receiver 82 arranged to pass an infrared signal through the coding 74, or a capacitive or magnetic reading arrangement. The coding 74 is preferably equally spaced and arranged to be a known distance apart in a binary format. Monitoring arrangements 76, 78 detected coding 74 and generate output signals representative of the detected position of the window 26. Controller 44 monitors outputs from arrangements 76, 78 through wires 77, 79 to track the position of the window 26 based on the coding 74. With a known window mass, the controller 44 can be programmed to determine the force applied against the window by an obstruction based on predetermined values. If the window is not in a parked (all the way up or down) state and the force exceeds a predetermined limit, the controller 44 change the direction of travel of the window 26 by instructing the motor 38 to stop and/or reverse the movement of the window. Referring now to FIGS. 7-10, alternative embodiments of the window position detection system for a vehicle door assembly of the present invention are disclosed. A window position detection and anti-pinch system 84 is provided on a vehicle door assembly 10 adjacent window pane 26. As is shown schematically in FIG. 7, system 84 uses a sensing arrangement 88, such as a rotary encoder, that monitors the position and velocity of the window as the window 26 travels through door assembly 10. Unlike prior art measuring systems which were mounted on or adjacent the motor 38 to measure changes in velocity at the motor, sensing arrangement 88 divorces itself from the motor altogether with the intention of providing clean pulses to a central processing unit or controller 90. Mounting sensing arrangement 88 adjacent window 26 provides a greater correlation between the measured values at the window to window velocity, force and position relative to the window frame 28. The window position detection system 84 includes an encoder 92 positioned adjacent to window and attached to a rotary member 94, such as a pulley or roller, via a shaft 96. The rotary member 94 is pressed against the window 26. In operation, the upward and downward travel of the window 26 in door assembly 10 rotates member 94. The rotational movement of member 94 is translated to the encoder 92 via shaft 96. The encoder can be arranged to provide a predetermined number of pulses per distance of movement of the window. The high resolution of this sensor, which can be tailored to the needs of the control system 84, provides a robust source of data for the controller 90. Further, because the data is directly based on actual window movement, rather than the velocity or the power output of the motor, the data provides a better correlation for determining the relative position of the window in operation or the presence of an obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28. As is shown in FIGS. 8(a)-(b), a third embodiment of the of present invention is shown providing a window position and velocity detection system 84 having a resistive or voltage sensing rotary encoding arrangement 88 in lieu of a pulse generating circuit from the motor. In this embodiment, the window 26 itself is used as the basis for determining the window's position and velocity. With this arrangement, system reliability is improved while also providing independence of the window control system design from the design of the motor and window manufacture. In accordance with this embodiment, a plurality of electrical contacts 98 are provided about the outer periphery 100 of rotary encoder 92. At least one corresponding electrical contact 102 is provided adjacent to and in engagement with electrical contacts 98 on rotary encoder 92. The at least one electrical contact 102 monitors pulses generated by the rotation of the electrical contacts 98 on rotary encoder 92 by the travel of the window 26 relative to window frame 28. Controller 90, responsive to the outputs from encoder 92 and in communication with the at least one electrical contact 102 through wires 104, electrically senses open and closed circuit connections between contacts 98 and 100 to determine the relative position, velocity and force of the window as well as the presence of any obstruction between the window 26 and window frame 28. FIGS. 9(a)-(b) show another embodiment of the window position detection system 84 of the present invention. In this embodiment, a multi-poled magnet 106 is centrally disposed on the rotary encoder 92 and aligned with the rotational axis 108 extending through shaft 96. A Hall effect sensor 108 is disposed radially outwardly of magnet 106 on an outer edge 112 of the rotary encoder 92. Sensor 108 communicates with controller 90 through wires 114 to provide pulse measurements of position and velocity by magnetically sensing the revolution of the multi-poled magnet 106 via the Hall effect sensor 108. Referring now to FIGS. 10(a)-(b), a fifth embodiment of the window position detection and anti-pinch system 84 of the present invention is disclosed. In this embodiment, rotary encoder 92 includes intermittent holes 116 positioned therein which allow a energy signal, such as an infrared light beam, to pass through. A photointerrupter 118 is positioned adjacent to and about the outer periphery of the rotary encoder 92. Photointerrupter 118 generates pulses in response to interruption of the infrared beam as the encoder rotates in response to the travel of the window 26 in door assembly 10. Photointerrupter 118 transmits these pulses to controller 90 through wires 120. Controller 90 monitors the output signals to determine the position of the window relative to the window frame and compares the output signals generated by the photointerrupter 118 to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window 26 and window frame 28. A description of the method of detecting the position of a window in a window frame of a vehicle door assembly of the present invention is described in greater detail below. A window position detection and anti-pinch system 36 described above is provided to monitor the position of the window 26 relative to the window frame 28. As is shown in FIGS. 1-6, sensing devices 42, 76, 78 are positioned adjacent window 26 and detect the binary coding of coding arrangement 40, 74 on window pane 26 as the window is raised and lowered to determine the position of the window relative to the window frame. Sensing devices 42, 76, 78 generate output signals based on the vertical position of the window in the window frame detected by the sensors. As shown in FIGS. 7-10, encoder 92 monitors the position of window 26 based on the rotational movement of rotary member 94. This information is transmitted from the sensing devices to the controller 44 for analysis. When the operator actuates switch 48, a signal is sent to controller 44 to activate reversible drive motor 38 to raise or lower window 26 in window frame 28. Simultaneously, controller 44 activates the window position detection and anti-pinch system to monitor the travel of the window as the drive motor 38 raises or lowers window 26. The controller 44 is responsive to the output signals generated by the sensing devices of system 36 to detect window position relative to the window frame 28. Controller 44 compares output signals against predetermined values to determine whether an obstruction exists between the window 26 and window frame 28. If the controller detects a discrepancy in the time intervals between interrupt signals corresponding to window distance traveled, controller 44 will generate a control signal to stop and reverse motor 38. Motor 38 will then lower the window 26 to allow an occupant to remove the object or obstruction from between the window and window frame. Additionally, system 36 may also generate a visual or audible warning for the occupants of a vehicle in response to a mismatched value found by controller 44. While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
