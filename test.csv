To alt ltvmm it muy confirm `13e tt. known that I, Joni: Hochmut, of 'lhomnstoin in the Stute of Moine, have n vented n new sind useful improvement or tltprovcments on locomotive-engines used on railroads and common roads by which inclined planes and hills muy he ascended and heavy loads drawn up the suine with more facility and eeonomv than heretofore, ncl hywhich the evil eflects of frost. ice, snows.. and nnn'l yon the ruil causing the wheels to slide nre obVinted. The ohstucles met with in ascending inclined planes jtvith locomotives drawing heavy loads after them, are 'the want of power in the engine; and the deficiency of adhesion to the railsgmy improvements arel desi ned to give n multiplied ttnctive power to l 1e locomotive and to prevent the evilof the sliding of the wheels., and for these. improvements I havemnde application for e potent to be issued according to the ypro visions of law. The 'followin is1afull and exa'ct description of sai improvementa To werent. `the Awheelsgfroni sliding on the rails make use of n check rnil,and retreating regs, the cogs are applied in the following manner, the wheels are. made in the common forni except, that the rim is somewhat wider from the flange to the nutside of the trend it should be no wider than to pass the rail sufficiently, and its width must. he further extended 12 inches. This extended part of the rim at the periphery thereof is li inches 'less in diameter than the hearing periphery. v The accompanying drawings are mntle a port of and are referred to in this desription for the better understanding thereof. A transverse section of the rim is seen at n. in Figure 2, Mnl it is more fully shown l in Fig. 3.

'ihctr nction is uttentirtl with rcry little frictione acting only when necessary to supply the deficiency of adhesion and their pressure against the tlnnlr of the teeth is only the balance of leverage which is not sustained by the sdhesion at the treed. They are not subject to the evils attending the use aliixed coge which must almost necessaril be broken in their first contact with s rocrr leid st the foot, or top' of an inclined plane if they do not chance to enter into geur, and whose stubbornness subjects them to frequent accidents, and injury, besides the great friction which attends their action under all circumstances. The retreating coge are endowed with the fncuity of getting out of the way when not wanted, and of instantly being in service without prompting, when their need is necessary. For planes much inclined the distance between the teeth should be such that the coge shall over lay them about 1l, of an inch. The coge should be applied to each of the workin wheels. To enab e locomotives to ascend inclined planes with heavy loads it is necessary also to give them sn increased trsctive power; I effect thlt object in the following manner, which in described es sp lieeble to geared locomotive engines, but a locomotives may be geared for this purpose. There are the driving shaft takin its motion from the connecting rod and t e followingshsft communicating the motion to the msm werking wheels by cranks, and shackle-bars. On the drivin shaft are oog wheels A., C, Fig. 4, fixed t0 the shaft, on the following shaft are ccrresponding wheels B, and. ke t eontantly in gear with A, and C. B, and are loose on the shaft, and revolve freely around it excet when the are alternately fixed, and heldptirmlv by e spears E and F, on either side of B, and D, are the supports G, and H, fixed to the shaft, they are perforated for the blades of the spears to pass throu h and enter between the urmsof the oog weels. The gs har l hss two forks whose rongsliein e ooves around the w ich are moved s together laterally y means of l. lever applied bo the gege'- bar, conveniently laced under the commend of the engineer, e spears have the aid of s feather on the shaft, as well es of the su rta G and H. By this means the whee s 1nd D are alternately held fest to the shaft as occasion may nire, when one is fast, the other revolves reely around the shaft without impediment to the one in service. It is readily ived that by increasing the diameter o the wheel D, and diminishing C, the tractive wer of the engine may be increased four old if desired in chan ing the running gear as above described. and B, are the common moving gear combin ing in due proportion speed, und power for the level, and moderately undulating part ofthe rond. On enterin upon the ascent of un inclined plane, or hi as the momentum acquired on the level is spent, and the power of the engine begins to fai, the engineer, cutting o the steam for nn instant, removes the spear E, and brings the other into gear by a single motion of the lever, without stopping the progress of the locomotive. lt is t us enabled to move on up the lane with less speed than un a level but wit u redonbled power. When arrived at the summit the other wheels are brought into action again in like manner, and the locomotive proceeds with its accustomed speed. 'lhc trsctive power of the engine may be thus doubled, trebled, or quadrupled to adapt it to the rading of the road on which ii. ig L0 be Another mode of changing tho gearing b holding fast the two wheels B, and D, a ternately is by means of levcrs placed in a. groovelengthwise the shalt, one srm of which being raised operates like s feather entering s notch or groove in the bush of the wheel, the xrms of the levers nre raised, and depressed by n slide, and gage bar ss shown in Fi 5. Another mode isiy moving the wheels E, and D, into, und out of ar ulternstel by s lst/eral motion on the s aft, effected y s gege bar with arms, es shown in Fig. tl, us also another mode as at Fig. 7. I have also s method of drewin the retreating cogs within their sockets. ut I do not consider this as neeessa to their successful ap liestion and use. t is however describe here as there may be circumstances undermhich its adoption may be useful. It is thus: the rod attached to the cog is continued of n. diminished size, not exceeding 11 of an inch, to within 1i inches of the nave where'it psssen freely through the end of a lever which lifts against n. nut on the ond of the rod. This lever seen nt in Figs. 2 and 3, passes in the direction of the axle inward, moves on s ivot in the projecting part of the nave nt and the other arm inclines toward the a as shown in Fi'f's. 2 and 3. Encirclin the axle at l, is a. circular slide through olea in which the arms of the levera pesa, und when moved on the axle from thensve it raises the arms from the axle, and thus draws the coge within their sockets. This slide is moved by the gage bar M, havin prongs which rest in the groove aroun the outer ed e of the slide This like the other gage are, are moved endwise in fixtures by means of l lever placed in any convenient manner to be within reach of the engineer. By this means whether the engine be nt rest or in motion, all the coge are drawn into their sockets at once by s single motion of the engineer. There is one lever between each two spokes, each raising two cogs. The principal advantage of this is the withdrawing the cogs from uction in not claim the aaid descending a plane, where a check ruil in laid when eir use is not neeeary, and thus avoiding the=wear of them. It may be found useful too on curves in an ascending plane to withdraw the cop of the inside wheels from action, facilitating the adjudment of the wheels to the curved rails. Now what I a my invention arr- 1.

At the other end of the mandrel t, is one fixed v a oval formed chuck zu, Ifnade4 to receive-the' form piece Gr, and having a VSocket toreceive the center off' the shift-ingeval formed chuck e. This chuck m is also made to hold-the form piece y, bolts the shifting spur dogs 1, 1, are mount-r ed, and held to the requiredk distance` apart-.f The conjugate centers of both these chucks,` f i and of the'form piece'are eccentric ""with the center of the mandrel t to allow the centerpin hole of the block intended for rouiidingv to come in .the center ofthe pin 2,sothat helpsl to secure it in place. t In the drawing whichl'jaeeompanies this specification, they standing) `mandrel tf and firmly by twovv boltS, 'andthe is ,madeY withtwo slots iat; 'n Y the conjugate ends in which by twok screw f I cheeks are shown as all in one piece by which the form piece y cannot be changed without removing the mandrel t out of the bearings 0, o, and making the wheel r, to slide the form piece on the mandrel, and fiX the form piece in the back of the chuck which thereby gives the chucks the appearance of being back to back. By the mode which is specified this delay, and inconvenience is obviated as the form piece y, can be placed on the mandrel t, by merely removing the chuck e, while the form y is fixed on the chuck andthen replacing the chuck z, for work as hereafter described. i5 At the other end of the swing frame B, and corresponding `with the standing Amandrel Y is the sliding mandrel s, which slides on bearers on the frameV B, and carries the wheel 4. This wheel gears into the sliding .pinion 572, already named as being mounted on the long arbor O. By these means the motion ofthe two mandrels is always the same upon being set to work as hereinafter described. 4Upon the inner end of the sliding mandrel s, is the fixed oval formed chuck 5, which is made withv slots Yto hold spur dogs G, and screws to secure them, the set eccentric with the center of the mandrel s and having a pin 7, for the hole in the block, the same asV the before described shifting chuck, both the pins 2, and 7, being made to shift for the convenience of putting f in larger, or smaller pins, as may be needed, Y and when one of the required size-is put in place it is kept there VVbya small set screw through the side of the mandrel. The slidingv mandrel s, is regulated as to position by the long back center screw 8, in the stirrup 9, having the nose turned to button from whichbutton is retained to the end of the mandrel by the valved Hanched cover 10, screwed on so that it incloses the button of the screw nose. On the screw 8, is the crank handle 11, by whichthe workmanslhand ives and regu-V g a c lates the Ysliding motion of the mandrel sv and the mode by which this machine is set in operation is as follows: The shifting form piece y being made in the form, and sizeof the block intended for rounding is placed by the workmen so as to screw it on the fixed chuck and the centers of the' form wheel f', and cutter block y', being adjusted accurately coincident, or in the same continuousV line, and the centers of the mandrels t and s, being adjusted accurately parallel to vthis line, the cutter z', i, being also adjusted to describe a circle exactly of the same diameter as the form wheel y', 1. The worknan takes a block Vfor rounding, and placing it so that the lower, or as it is technically termed the arse end of the block -is against that dog spur which is at the least distance from the pins 2, and 7 He now enters those pins in the form piece, the holes on each side of the block, and seeing that the dog spurs come into the line of the longitudinal center of the block, he now by the crank handle ll, turns the screw 8, so as to bring the chucks w, and e, toward each other, and thereby makes them compress, and hold the block firmly in the position for rounding, and the cutters i, i, on the block 7L, having rapid rotary motion given by a belt on the drum j, the workman allows the swing frame B, to approach them until the form piece 1 and form wheel f, l, are in contact. The cutters will have then begun to operate on the block, and the workman gives the mandrels and chucks a rotary motion in the contrary direction to that of the cutters z', i, by the crank handle m. On the arbor O, and the gear wheels through which this is connected moves the mandrels t, and s, and the contact of the block with the cutters,being regulated by the form piece y, the cutters will operate like a plane to shape the block precisely similar to the form piece y. The workman must bring that part of the block where the cutters act against the grain move slowly around to avoid stripping, or splitting the wood, than is needful -where the cutters act with the grain. When the rotation of the mandrels is completed the block will be Vjfinished, and is to be removed by reversing the previousoperation, to make room for another to be entered, and operated on in precisely the same manner. By these means asetof blocks will be rounded exactly alikeV in size, and appearance. Then it is required to have the block rounded somewhat smaller than the form piece this may be done by setting the form wheel frame so much back from the center line as is required toallow the cutters taking oif more of the material, and if on the contrary it is desired to round the block larger than this may be accomplished by setting the form wheel frame forward of the center so as to make the cutters takeoff less material.` And, I, the said THOMAS BLANCHARD, do hereby declare that I claim as my invention- Y l. The application of rotary cutters fitted with a double iron, or cap to make them cut more smoothly either with, or against the grain,ofthewood. A 2. I also claim as my invention the form of chucks with the dog spurs, and center pins herein described for holding the block, and carrying the same around by compressing the same on both sides while the same is being operated on the said chucks being fitted eccentrically with the mandrels for the purpose of placing the block in a proper position for the cutters to form the side of the block as'the same is presented to them by the shape of the form board. 3: And I claim as my invention the combinatlon of machinery, as herein before substantially specified, and described by which such cutters, and chucks are brought into 5 operation for the purpose of rounding, 01' stock sheavng blocks. In testimony whereof I have hereunto sety my hand August 11, 1835. THOMAS BLANCHARD. Witnesses: JOHN N. TAYLOR, JAS. H. SNFORD."

' A, AA, A, are four vertical posts, B, B, B, B, are four cross timbers, andC, C, are two lengthwise timbers. machinery is Xed for work, and are represented as of wood, but may be made of iron.l Upon each of the upper pair of cross frame. pieces B, is fixed a metal railway A, A, serving as tracks, and guides for four rollers b, b, b, Z), having flanges ony the inner edges to keep them in place. These rollers carry the two longitudinal arbors c, o, and upon edges of the interior longitudinalslide frame. c, in which are four connectin cross bars eZ, CZ, cZ, cZ, vthe tw'oright hand of these being fitted with slots in the front ends, over these slot-s is placed the carriage bar e, having in it the screw center pivot f, with a wide thumb iece for conveniently turning the screw. At the back of the slide frame c, is a bearing block 'f/,Vandcorresponding with that, and the bar e, is the bearer bar h, made with flat fianged ends having slots which allow it to be placed at the needful distance, both from the block g, and the center bar e. Thespur plate, and block i, are set into the block g, so as to overlay, and be supported by the bar h, and the position ofthe spur Z is regulated by- These forni the standard frame on which the whole of' the laat the back of the block g, Von which a the back lcenter screw j, fixed on the stirrup i small screw fixes the position of the spur z', when once regulated for the purposes hereafter described. yOn the two bars, eZ, CZ, at the left hand partA of'V the slide-frame O, is a smaller interior slide frame D, retained in place by the'four slide pieces Z, Z, Z, Z, and having al horizontalV motion which is directed, and regulated by the tooth rack M, `having geared into it the j pinion N, set on the arbor O, which is mounted in the bearings p, p, having the ,crank handle g, atthe outer end. Upon the yframe D, are fixed the two bearings r, 7, inwhich drum, or pulley t, fitted on it, which maybe arrangedy so as to be connectedV to a prime mover in any effectual mechanical manner. Upon, or in the nose of the mandril S, is k,theaugerniandrel S, is mounted having the fitted the screw auger U, which maybe made j to shift so as to fixv an auger of any required size. Immediately below the right f hand part of the traverse l frame B, upon `the back part of the two lengthwise timbers O, C, are screwed two vertical slide pieces o, 22,'A and in these is the Vertical slide frame E, having two cross bars on which are fixed the bearing fw, fw, so as to'receive the vertical mandril, or bit stock x, working ,in a'pivot on the lower bearing, and having a socket, or female screwto receive the bit y, the shaft of which is solid steel, or good case'hardened iron the top being so fitted on one side that the steel cutter e, may be put in, and held securely by a screw cut in from the oppositeside of the bit, and finished with a countersink flush head, having a notch inthemanel ner of a common wood screw used by carpenters, and when thus finished as ishown in the detached Fig. 2, the cutting. part of-1- this belt is Very similar to theibit technically -known by the name of the i spoon bit. y Upon the bit stock, or mandrel X, is the drum, or pulley Z1, fittedV to communicate a through these eyes is rove the cord X1,`the i` ends of which are connected to .thehorizon tal winch 71, set in gearings hung under the upper frame piecerC, and having the ratchet wheel V?, and crank handle fw?, on its outer end, the long pawl t, being fixed very rapid rotary motion to the bit (y, by la' 'I i on the lower cross bearer B, so that by its .action through the ratchet wheel V1, italways bears the standing weight of the frame E. Upon the side of the right hand post A, is fixed the vertical lever S, connected by the strap r1, to the treadle g1, over the small pulley P1, fixed on a standing bracket, or carriage on the cross frame B; above this is the lower slide bar O1, having a ratchet pawl w1, above the slide bar fitted on a small Vcarriage having a slot and screw to adjust it for ratching into the upper part of the wheel V1, at the proper time of doing so when in motion as hereafter described, and a reversed pawl M1, on the other side of the ratchet wheel V1, acting below and-downward, and xed with screws in a slot. Above and on the inside of the vertical lever S1, is the connectingbar Z1, madeV in two parts, one part connected by a pin joint at one end` to the lever S1, and the other part connected at the opposite end to one corner of the traverse frame B, the required distance between the lever S1, VandY the cornerV of the frame B, being maintained and regulated by slots in one part through which screws go into the other part-so' as to holdV the two parts to any desired adjust-ment of their joint length. On the back posts A, A, are two bearings L1, k1, in which the crank shaft j1, revolves, the motion being given by a belt from any first mover to the drum, or pulley 1. These in practice may be fixed to any convenient part of the building wherein the machine is fixed for use. On the crank shaft outside the drum 1, is a square head in which is a mortise made to receive the shifting crank arm, and pin h1, which is secured at any required radius by a screw, or gibs, and keys, or in any effective mechanical manner. The walking beam g1, is coupled on the pin of the crank arm h1, and is made of a length to reach the tenon at the top of the vertical lever s1, which enters and is Vconnected with the walking beam at that part by a mortise made for that purpose. Immediately over the spoon bit Y, are fixed two vertical pieces of timber F, F, shown in the drawing as fixed to the frame, but which in practice for use 'in a full sized machine may be best hung and braced securely from the fioor above the machine, or if made of iron may be fixed steadily in a standard frame rising out of the main body of the machine. Upon these timbers F, F, are fixed two slide guide pieces f1, f1, and between them is the slide e1, having mounted on it at the lower end a metal vertical plane, with a cutter, and mortise d1, both stock and cutter formed nearly in the way as the common carpenters rebate plane, except that the cutter is set square, and near the point in the plane stock which descends some distance below the slide e1 to the upper end 'of the slide e1. The connecting rod or pitman piece c1, is jointed, and is regulated so as to ascend to, and be coupled onto a crank on a horizontal shaft fixed in vertical bearing carriages secured to the frame, or Hoor above the machine, and having drums orpulleys to connect the working parts last described to a first moving power, which drums, or pulleys to avoid complexity are not shown in the drawings. Underneath the traverse frame B, is the hand lever b1, having'its fulcrum jointed on a crutch screwed into, and extending beyond v Vframe C, is a'stud working into a slot in the lever b1. 'By this lever, and slot the workman can move the slide frame e, longitudinally inside the traverse frame B, and fix it at any required adjustment as follows. The index gage plate a1, is screwed on the upper side of t-he front of the traverse frame B, having holes in its length, and slots near the ends by which it can be screwed in any definite position within -the limits of itsA size, theV holes beingV index gages or numbered joints mto denote the distance it is required to move the slide frame C, in the large frame B, to place the block over the bit y, so as to obtain any required number, and distance in mortises. Upon the frame C, is fixed the tail of the index spring a2, into anyhole in the index gage plate a1, and thereby secure the slide frame Z, as may be required for the following purposes. When it is desired to make the mortise in a ships tackle block for the reception of the sheave, and bore it for the pin, the machine as before described is first to be carefully adjusted by measure to the proper position for obtaining the required size, and position of mortise, and pin hole, and also have all the working parts duly connected to a first moving power. A block of the required size having been shapedY from the rough wood, and having at the part intended for the head a center mark to be entered by the screw center f, ion and at the part termed by block makers t-he arse VThree spur marks corresponding to the spurs 1n the spur platel z', is to be placed between these two points in the frame Q, and tightly screwed in by the screw center f; the workman then, byA putting his foot on the treadle g1, forces the, lever S1, toward the back of the machine, where the pawl u1, taking into the teeth of the ratchet wheel w1, forces it around in the same direction'carrying the winch w1, around, and winding the cord x1 around it so as to raise the bit frame E, and bring the spoon bit y, up near the block, and returning the lever S1, back by hand the reverse pawl m, t-akes into the ratchet wheelv1, and again lifts the spoon bit y, nearer the block, or in a small machine the worlnnan may accomplish this objectV by turning the crank handle u1, in the same direction. The walking beam g having previously hung out of gear on a hook is now brought down for the upper point of the lever S to enter the mortise prepared for it, and being moved alternately back and forward by the crank arm hf, operates through the lower slide bar o', and the pawls n', and m, and ratchet wheel o, and winch w, and cord m', to raise the frame E, and spoon bit y, a certain regulated distance at each alternation of the lever S. While this is doing alternations of the lever S', operating through the connecting bar Z, on the traverse frame B, will carry it' back, and forward on the rollers b, b, b, by The length of the mortise required to be made in the block by which the spoon bit y, is made to cut horizontally as well as vertically, and thus make a mortise having two round ends through the block, whose length is regulated both by the radius of the shifting crank arm 71X, and by two metal gage i stops xed on the right hand upper crossframe B, and made with slots through which they can be screwed to, and maintained in .any required position. So soon as the spoon bit y, commences to cut, the workman should set the auger u, to bore the pinhole in the block by turning the crank handle g, and sending the auger up to, and through the block that is being operated on, it being a saving of time to effect this operation while the spoon bit is cutting the mortise, and before that can come so high as to touch the auger while boring the pinhole. l/Vhen these operations are thus far completed, the workman lifts 0E the walking frame g', from the upper end of the lever S', and first securing the frame B, in the proper position with the front arbor C, against the front gage stop, he lowers the frame E, by the winch lw"", and raises it so as to make the bit y, cut a clean round end to the head part of the mortise in the block operated on, and when this is iinished he. lowers the frame E, so as to take the spoon bit out of the way, and draws the frame B, forward so as to stop the inside of the backv arbor C, against the back lgage stop, and holding it there, puts the crank shaft into operation, which sets the square, or arising chisel el', into work, and this by a rapid alternation of descent, and ascent cuts out the opposite vor as it is. technically termed the arse end of the mortise square, and the workman now puts the chisel d', out of gear, and removes the block, whose mortise is now so far finished to make room for others in succession to be mortised in t-he same way. And I the said THoMAs BLANCHARD do hereby declare that I do claim as my inventionl. The movable cutter, or lip to the spoon bit as thesame is herein specifically described. y 2. And I do herein further claim as my invention that hereinbefore specified arrangement of machinery, and tools by which the workman is enabled to bore the hole in a block for the sheave pin at the same time that the mortise is being made for the sheave. 3. And I also claim as my invention the application of a cutter fixed in a metal plane stock similar to the rebate plane in such a way that the lower or arse end of a block may be nished with a square end Y V to the mortise .for the sheave without being moved from that part of the machine wherein the mortise has been made. 4. I also claim as my invention the application of the index gage plate with numbered holes, and the index spring plates, and stud to regulate the working of the machinery so as to bore at any required distance any number of mortises or blocks l so far as the size of the machine will allow. 5. And I do hereby declare that I do not claim as my invention any other of the several parts of the said machine, the same lligaving been long previously well known. 6. I do further, and finally claim as my invention that entire mechanical arrangement of other well known parts in combination with parts invented, and brought into use by me, that is hereinbefore substantially described, and set forth as my new, and useful improvement in machinery for mortising and boring ships tackle blocks, which machinery may also be made applicallolek to other useful purposes of a similar (ind. y 7 And I claim as my invention, and im' Trios.

To all whom it may concern Be it known that l', THOMAS BLANCHARD, of the city, county, and State of New York, have made certain new and useful improve ments in machinery for formingparts of made tackle-blocks, or, as they are technically called, plank-blocks, Vfor ships and other purposes in a better manner than has been done by hand or in any other way, and that the said improvement and the machinery by which the same are ed'ected and the method of constructing and using the same are fully and correctly set' forth in the following specification and inthe drawing anneXed to and making a part of this specification, 'whereiny The principal figure represents the ma chine I use for the purpose of making the end pieces of plank, or made blocks, and the several parts thereof are as follows: A, is a lower bearer. B, is, an upright standard post in the bearer A. C', is a small post in front to support D, D, two bearing blocks connected at one end to B, and E, is a small post behind serving as a fulcrum post. These are the fixed parts represented as of wood, but may be made of iron, on which the working parts of the machine are mounted. a, a, are two lower, al, a1 are twoupper metal slide ways with slots through which they are screwed, and adjusted into the standard B, by screw bolts l, 1, l, 1. These slide ways may if 'so chosen be made in one piece on each side. The side set screws 2, 2, 2, 2, give, and retain the lateral position of these ways as wanted. b, is a balance lever one end sliding in a mortise in the standard B, and having the fulcrum on a bolt in the part At thc back end of this lever is the weight F, and the other end coming through a slot in the side piece e, in front of the post, B, the joint c, connects the lever to the lower end of the rod al, and this connecting rod is again jointed to the middle part of the lower slide piece e, which has a shoulder flanch, or step near the middle to receive the stop of the lower carrier block f, with the lower center bracket g, upon it. These are screwed to the slide piece by holding screws 3, 3, and adjusted by set screws 4, 4. Above in the slide way the upper slide piece el, is set in reverse with the lower slide e, and has the corner block f1, and center bracket, g1, on the lower bracket, and held, and ady justed by screws 81, and set screws 41, inthe same way, and on the part corresponding g to the joint on the lower slides is the eye 7L, E and to this is fastened the cord c', over the Lslot in the slide above this is the vertical 5 guiderod lo, held by bolts through the slot, e j and having 'at top a return end projecting l out in front at right angles."" j In the bearings Z, Z, ismountedf the small 1 winch m, moved by the small crank handle n a. rThe cord z', goesround this winch, andl i up toward the guide rod lo, when the cord is fastened through the eye of the adjusting l screw eye bolt O, so that the slide f1, may be moved up, ordown by turning the crank handle @,but the same object `may be obtained by a rack, and pinion, or a small chain in place of a cord. f Upon bearings p, p, in the blocks D, D, the revolving cut-ter shaftV g, is mountedkmade square between the bearings p, p, having on it two pairs of straight edged cutters 1, ""1*, which edges are at rightjangles to the cutter shaft center with the cutting edges inward facing each other, and fitted to stand in cutting at the angle with a. carpenters plane iron having slots in their stocks to allow of adjustment, and fixture by screws going through the slots into the stock, brackets, and bearings on the shaft of, and between the stock brackets of these two cutters, on theother flat sides of the shaft g, arev fixed the straight edged cutter S, and the round edged cutter z5, also held by screws going throughslots to allow of their adjustment.V The drum, or pulley V, gives motion tothe cutters by a belt, or band to any rst mover, and the use of this machine as thus described is to shape the pieces forming the ends of the mortices in made, or plank blocks in the following manner. If the workman intends to form the hollow, or mortise in the block, he withdraws the -4 round edged cutter from operation, and advances the straight edged one. In either Y case adjusting the right angled cutters 1"", r, to strip the sides of the piece of wood eX- actly, to the thickness required by the mortise of the intended block before he begins to work the machine, then a piece cut nearly to the length required is placed endwise upon the lower center bracket g, where the lateral position is adjusted by the gage piece in working by a screw through a slot into the gage bracket w. The workman now turns the small winch m, by the crank handle n, so that the upper center bracket g1, comes down, and holds the piece of wood firmly between the two brackets, and the workman continuing to turn the Winch overcomes the resistance of the balance lever b, and the weight F, and forces the lower slide piece e, and ts'fixtures downward so as to carry theV piece of wood entirely below the operation of the revolving cutters. By this means the wood in the passage from the upper to the lower is entirelystripped of all superfluous material on-three sides, and reduced exactly to the shape, and size which is required in setting up the block about to be made. The workman reversing the operation at the winch m, brings the piece up again, and removes it, leaving the space between the center brackets open for other pieces to be successively formed in a similar manner. And I the said THOMAS BLANCH- ARD do hereby claim as my invention- The applica-tion of rotary or revolving cutters acting at right angles to the shaft to which they are aiiiXed, and set at a cutting angle similar to that of a carpenters plane iron so as to form a clean drawing stroke with the grain of the wood to be operated on together with the round edged, and straight edged cutters parallel to the sha-ft, as the same are herein. substantially set forth, and described as being applied by me to the purpose of thereby forming at one operation three'sides of the end pieces for made tackle blocks of any required size.

When 1t is desired tobore dead eyes, the machine is lirst adjusted by measure to the proper distances between all parts, and rapid rotary mot-ion being given to the bit ci, by a belt on the pulley F, from any VK'first mover. The workman puts a block of wood, previously prepared for the purpose, be- tween the spur block h, and the center screw C, and securing it there by turning the ceni Y terv point into it, he then grasps the end of the lever t, and advances the whole ofthe work on the railway toward the boring bit- CZ, he causes the upper one of the guide bars e, to enter whichever mortise in the form block r, he pleases, and the lower steady bar w, to pass between the corresponding guide plates V, V, thus steadying the whole eectually and continuing the motion until the bit bores a straight hole in the dead eye, and the lower guide piece is within the form block r. He then withdraws, and raises the fork, and machineryattached to it, bring. ing the rounded end of the lowergude bar e, in contact with that part in the mortise of the form block, which is rounded, andl moving it upward, and downward. The compound curve formed by moving the form block in contact with the lower guidel bar e, causes the'bit to cut the lanyard'score, f, to one hole, on that sideof the dead eye, the around carrying the guide block, and dead eye with it, and the opposite side of the dead eye is presented by the Workman to undergo a similar operation With the bit. When the size of the dead eye admits it, three bits can be used at once, and conse quently all three holes bored at one opera- 1 tion by putting in two additional angers, or bits, secured by brackets bolted in the slots a, a, a, a, and by adjusting them Vto proper distances, the guide bar e, only enters thercenter mortise in the form block, and the operation in other respects is performed as before described. And I, the said THOMAS BLANCHARD, do hereby declare that Ido not claim as my invention any ofthe separate parts of the above described machine, but I do claim as my invention- The combination of the several parts of said machine as herein described, and used by me, and applied to the purpose of boring the holes, and cutting'the lanyard scores in what are technically termed dead eyes with one, or more boring bits, substantially in. the manner above described, and set forth.

To all whom t may concern Be it known that I, THOMAS BLANCHARD, late of Springfield, in the county of-Hampden and State of Massachusetts, but now of the city, county, and State of New York, have made, invented, and applied to use certain new and useful improvements in machinery adapted to cutting the scores or hollows for the reception of the rope or iron bands around ships tackle-blocks and Vdead-eyes, and that the said improvements Vare fully set forth in the following description and in the accompanying drawing forming a part of this specification, in which- Figure l, is an horizontal plan ;v Fig. 2, is a vertical front elevation, and Fig. 3, is a vertical cross section of the machine in which the same letters, figures of reference are used to denote the similar parts in all the different figures. A, A, A, A, are four feet supporting the standards B, B, to which is attached the frame C, this is fitted to receive the friction wheel D, at one end, this 'friction wheel is fitted to be raised or lowered by the thumb screws Z), b, which` work into, and/ raise, or depress the bearings a, a, on which the wheel revolves. At the other end of the frame C, the revolving cutter wheel E, set on the arbor c, and having the hooked knives, or cutters d, d, a?, ai, secured to it, these cutters are made removable to give place to larger, or smaller, or dierent num- ,bers as required, e is a pulley which gives motion to this wheel. The upper partof the standards B, B, are elongated, and curved back to receive center screws f, f, going through them to support the swinging frame g. Over the friction wheel, and upon the swing frame in bearings h, L, is the arbor t', to which at one end is fit-ted the large hand wheel K, for the workman'to turn the arbor by, attached to the arbor, and nearly over the friction wheel D, is the flange Z, against which, and directiy over the friction wheel is the shifting form board on which is formed to regulate the depth, and shape of the score to be cut. On the end of the arbor z', and near by the cutting wheel E, is the crosshead n, made with slots to secure, and adjust the holders, or tongs O, O, made with one straight, and one pointed arm, and in front of the crosshead, is the gage stop p, and the back of the swing frame. On the lever tongs o, o, into the two sister holes t, t, for thelaniard of the dead eye shown in the detached Fig. 4, and pushes them through until it stops against the page stop p, and vby compressing the two arms of the tongs in one hand, he forces the iiange s, on the jointed arm to hold the dead eye, or block firm, he then by they other hand depresses the spring frame, and allows the cutters to cut into the dead eye untilthe form boardm, comes in kcontact with the friction wheel D. He then by means of the band wheel K, turns the arbor, and tongs, and dead eye together causing the cutters d, CZ, to cut the score around that part of the dea-d eye which is with the grain of the wood, the form board being made so as toy raise the swing frame when the cutters come against the grain. He then removes the dead eye from the tongs 0, and turns it around, and puts it on again with the other side of the stop p, and repeating the above described motion cuts the remainder of the score, then removes it to make way for others to be operated on in'a similar manner. When it is desired to cut the score around a ships tackle block, a form on the same principle, but different in shape is used, and the block is held on the same sort of tongs which go through the` mortise of the block, and the operation of scoring is performed exactly in the same manner as that already described for dead eyes.

Then suppose there be a hub through these bottoms of a convenient length, and diameter, and the form of this wheel is perceived but the hub should be about twenty inches in length, and large enough to receive an arbor of eight or nine inches in diameter which is fixed therein, and its ends turn in boxes at convenient distances from the hub, that is as near as may be for the sake of greater solidity in operation. This wheel it is contemplated should be made of cast iron and weigh about twenty five hundred pounds. The diameter of the spoke, and hub part thereof being about thirty inches, and the flaring periphery extending twenty to twenty four inches more of diameter. In these peripheries are set the plane irons. The Vspoke part of this wheel should be three inches or more thick, and the flaring peripheries should each be two inches thick, having mortises cast therein for .the lane irons, which can be adjusted therein 1n like manner as in planes, but fixed in their places with screws. These plane-irons must be set in these Haring peripheries in a line with the axis of the arbor, but parallel with the faces 'of the iaring peripheries respectively. They must be strong, and of the best temu per. The frame in which this wheel is set should be massive and firm. It should be long enough to contain in the troughhere inafter described, the longest piecev of wood contem'platedVlr tobecut or shaved.

To this effect the trough is shaped on its sides sloping inwards to the bottom and its bottom as well as these sides terminate against the wheel in precise conformity'with the flaring flanges or peripheries, but the wheel must revolve free of this end of the trough so that the cutters which project beyond their faces shall not touch the said end of the trough, but yet revolve as closely as may be without touching it. l The wood being placed in the trough for operation it is forced against the wheel, and subjected to the action of the plane irons by a strong bar, or bars-running in a groove formed on the top edge of the trough Vby bars of iron projecting over each edge respectively, and thus guiding this bar which are set at several points to stick into the wood, and keep it steady, this bar is connected with a piece of iron extending the whole length of 'the trough having ratchet teeth into which a pinion is made to take the pinion being turned by any convenient common mechanism taking its motion from the. arbor of the wheel, and regulated so as to turn up the wood as fast as wanted, or the wood may be forced up by a spring, or a weight acting on said bar. The frame should be about three and a half, or four chine may be the same. The frame may be constructed` of wood, but this applicant recommends cast iron in preference. This vapplicant describes in the next place the principle of this invention. It consists in the combination of wheel having plane irons, or cutters set therein substantially as above, and hereinafter is described, with a trough, and regulated driver, or feeder sub1 stantially as above described, and it is for this combination, however it may be varied, that this applicant claims a patent upon this specification. i This applicant contemplates the application of the principle of his invention to the shaving or cutting up of all kinds dye-wood, and dye-stuffs that can be placed in a trough shaped as aforesaid and forced, or driven against the faces of the Haring peripheries aforesaid and substantially in the mode aforesaid Y This applicant does not claim the invention of a wheel with cutting, or plane irons set therein, but Y The invention of wheel with faces inclinedV to each other, wherein the plane-irons are set, in combination as aforesaid, the cutters taking the wood not at right angles with the grain of the wood, but diagonally as a penknife when used in cutting toward the persons wrist who uses it.

'IMPROVEMENT IN TRUSSES FOR THE CURE 0F PROLAPSUS UTERI. Spoclieation forming part of Letters Patent dated May 7, 1834; Rclssue No. l 2., dated September 14, 1839. T0 all whom, ri may concern: Be it known that AMos G. HULL, late of the city of New York, deceased, did invent a surgical apparatus for the relief and cure of procidentia and p rolapsis uteri and other diseases dependent on relaxation oi' the viseera of the pelvis, otherwise known as Dn A. G. Hulls Utero-Abdominal Supporter,7 for which invention Letters Patent were granted to said Aires G. HULL bearing date the 7th day of May, in the year 1831i. Said Letters Patent were assigned to me, ANOS GERALD HULL, by J ouN F. GRAY, administrator of the estate of the said Amos G. HULL, deceased; and I herewith su rrcndcr the same on account of defective spccilication, oii'cring the following description in amendment thereof: A surgical apparatus for the cure of falling of the womb, (or prolapsus proeidentianteri,) which apparatus said Anios G. HULL did make and vend by the name of Utero-Abdominal Supporter. The inventor of this apparatus diseov ered that pressure made upon or against the lower part ofthe abodomen, in manner and by means substantially the same as herein described, does always relieve, and very often eiiectually cure, the malady in females commonly called falling ofthe womb.77 Before the discovery of this apparatus the malady was treated in the last resort by the introduction of props or blocks into the vagina (pas` sage leading to the womb) to prevent the womb from falling down or from being pressed down and out through said vagina. These props, however constructed, were called pessaries. membrane with which it is in perpetual contact, sometimes causing inllammation, ulceration, and even death, and at best it is a merely palliative expedient, tending rather to perpetuate than to cause a removal of the prolapsus by distending the vagina and tormenting the patient. Hence it occurred that bei'ore the date of this invention coniirmed prolapsus was considered incurable, resisting medical treatment, and subjecting the sublject of it to the unhappy necessity of wearing pessaries during the remainder of her days. This apparatus, instead of propping up the womb from below, as the pessary does, hasits main pressure above the site of that organ, The iessar irritates the delicate` above the hypogastric portion of the abdomen, and operates, as the inventor supposed, by counteracting the depressing forces of the diaphragm and upper part of the belly to relieve the womb from the weight of the intestines above it, whereby itwas pushed down and extruded from the lower outlet of the pelvis. The inventor also thought that by pressing the hypogastriuxn obliquely upward and backward it might render the peritoneal connections of the uterus tense, and thus raise it to or suspend it in its place by a lifting process. However other surgeons might explain the principle upon whiclthe apparatus cured the prolapsus, the inventor claimed to be the discoverer of the means by which such salutary result was eected. Description of the utero abdominal supporter: This apparatus consists, in part, of a hypogastric pad, a a a a, Figure l, made of such size and shape as to adapt it accurately to all that part of the moving front wall ofthe belly lying below aline subtended between the anterior and superior processes of the iliac boues of the pelvis. This space, which de fines the size and shape of the hypogastrie pad, is bound below by the pubes, and at the sides by the upright margins of the iliac or hauneh bones. This pad lis therefore of an irregular' cordiform shape, much dilated laterally, and indented on its lower or pubic margiu to correspond to the shape of the upper line ot' the pubes, against which it rests. The position of this pad when applied is exhibited in Fig. 3. This pad (the hypogastric) is made of a thin plate of -inetal or other suitable material, divided near its vertical axis into two wings by a hinge eontrivance, as seen in Fig. 4, which represents the pad-plate of its ordinary size. The object of this hinge contrvanee is to give to the inner or belly aspect of the whole pad a form which approaches that of a double inclined plane, the angle of which double plane may be increased or diminished to any desirable or necessary extent with facility, without removing the apparatus from the patient, by means hereinafter named. The plate of the hypogastric pad may also, in some eases, be made entire without the hinge. The padplate, whether hinged or not, is covered with pad, and ' segment, or half of cloth and leather, or either, and wadded on its inner aspect, so as to make a proper cushion for the belly of the patient. The utero'abdominal supporter further consists of a steel spring, b b, Fig. 1, and a back pad, c, Fig. 1, like the springs and countc.- pads ordinarily used in trusses for ruptures, in which the spring encompasses one-half the body and thc back pad rests on the spine of the patient. The spring is covered with cloth and leather or other suitable material. In front the spring crosses the center of the back or outer surface of the hypogastric pad, and terminates, as shown at f, Fig. 1, on the left segment or side of it, near the edge. The spring may be made fast at the center of the outer surface of the pad by means of a button-headed mortise, through which it should pass, or any convenient fixture. In some instances it is desirable to make the strongest pressure by the lower or pubic portion of the hypogastric pad. To effect this the' rotary wedge of -Amos G. llulls truss for varicoeelc, patented July 5, 1833, may be attached so as to play between the spring attachment to the pad and the back of the pad sce Figs. 1, 3, and 4) at a. In many cases it is found serviceable to make a much stronger pressure than can be convenientl y derived from the spring alone,which may be effected by conveying a strap from t-he back or counter pad, c, around the side of the body opposite the spring b Z to the hypogastric pad, makin g a complete elastic belt around the pelvis, as seen in Fig. 2, where said strap ff is divided into two thongs, g g, which are made fast by two knobs on the back of said hypogastrie pad. This apparatus further consists of a sliding wedge, d, Figs. 1 aud 2intcrposed between the right segment of the hypogastric pad and the spring where it covers that part of the pad. The spring being hoop-shaped, und terminating ou the left half of the pad, where it presses much the strongest, this wedge cqualizes the pressure of the two segments or halves of the when the vertical hinge in the pailplate is used, sliding this wedge forward or backward depresses or elevates the right wing, the pad, altering the eapacity of the inner' or belly aspect of the pad to suit the various and changing states of the hypogastric region with respect to plumpuess or convcxity; and in ease the patient is so formed as that the front margins of the haunchbones project considerably, as is apt to be the casein prolapsus of long standing, the combined effect of this sliding wedge, the vertical hinge, and the free end of the spring is to sink the right and left margins of the pad a a a a below the `level of said projecting haunchbones, making the inner surface of the pad in this case also correspond to the shape of the hypoga stric region under the various attitude r and states of the body. In very full subjects the pad may be applied entire without the hinge. The 'apparatus further consists, in some cases, of a contrivance for pressing the anoperineal region of the body (perineum) upward and forward, called perineal strap, .li h, Fig. 2. The perineal strap extends from the counter-pad c', Figs. 1 and 2,' to the hypogastric pall, traversing closely the ano-perineal region in .its course. This stra-p may be made of leather and cloth or other suitable material, and be fastened to the pads aforesaid by knobs or other convenient fixtures, To the inner or perineal aspect of this strap is attached a cushion, i, Fig. 2, made of cloth and covered with oiled silk. rlhe cushion may be about an inch thick at right angles with the strap, and it should be of such length and so attached to the stmp as to press against all the space lying between the tip of the es coccygis and the fourchette or lower endv of the vulva. What is claimed in the within-described apparatus as the invention of the late AMes G. HULL is- The hypogastric pad a aa a and the cmploy- V ment thereof for the cure of prolapsns uteri, the same being made and operating substantially as herein set forth; likewise the combination of the said hypogastric pad with the spring b b, the sliding wedge d, and the counter or back pad, c; and also the combination of the perineal strap h h and cushion with the hypogastric'pad and its appendages, as herein described. No separate part of this apparatus is claimed as new except the said hypogastric pad; nor are any ox' the materials of which th 4everal parts of the apparatus are composee new or claimed as such in this specification.

To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, JOHN SOWLE, of New Bedford, in the State of Massachusetts, the following is a full and exact description thereof. It has been the practice heretofore in laying veneers upon ogee moldings, and others of a similar character to lay the veneer by means of a caul or reversel molding, well known to cabinet makers, upon a single molding at a time, and it has required much care, and address to lay the veneer soundly throughout but by the mode which I have invented, a large portion of the time which has heretofore been required in effecting this object is saved. The process can be performed by an ordinary workman, and the materials are used with increased economy. I out the pine, or other stufi upon which the veneer is to be laid of double the width of the intended molding, as it is to be stuck double, one molding from each edge, so that in an ogee the two rounds meet in the middle of the piece. I prepare a caul adapted to this double molding fitting across, and embracing its two sides like a saddle. The veneer to be laid must of course be of double width, so as to cover the two moldings, which are to be sawed apart after the veneering is completed. WVhen the moldings, and cauls are prepared in this way a number of them may be laid at once, placing them one upon another, and using proper screws to force them down. Having thus fully described my said invention, and the manner in which I carry the same into operation, I do hereby declare that all which I claim in the within described process of laying veneers upon ogee or other moldings is- The effecting the same by means of a double caul, in the manner, and upon the principle herein set forth.

APPLICATION OF CAOUTGHOUC TO CLO'II-IS, LEATHER, AND OTHER ARTICLES. I Specification of Letters Patent No. 16, dated August 31, 1836. To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, EDWIN M. CHAFFEE, of R-oxbury, in the county of Norfolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have invented, made, and applied ,to use a new and useful improvement in the preparing, coloring, and applying india-rubber to cloth of all kinds, leather, and other articles Without the use of a solvent, which I call Chaifees Improvement in Rubber, specified in the words and figures following and exhibited in the drawings annexed. The indie, rubber undergoes an operation preparatory to its being applied to the cloth, and other articles, and the following is a description of that part of the machinery, and apparatus employed for the purpose. A hollow cylinder, or roller six feet long, and twenty seven inches in diameter heated by steam, or otherwise to about two hundred degrees of Fahrenheit, is surmounted by another cylinder of like length, and heatedin like manner, and eighteen inches in diameter, the large, and small cylinders come in contact with each other on one side at about ten inches distant from the top of the larger one. The large cylinder revolves much faster than the small one, so that there is a compound rolling, and slipping action between the cylinders. Five bars are laced on the top of the large cylinder side by side each other leaving a space of about three fourths of an inch between them, the bars are one and a half inch thick, twelve inches wide, and about six feet long, the edges which lie in contact with the cylinder are convex or circular, and so constructed that when one corner of the edge touches it, the other recedes from it thus leaving a wedge like space for the rubber to enter beneath the bars. W'hat I mean by the corner of the edge is the angles formed by the be sifted, or otherwise put into"" the spaces inches in diameter. If the rubber is to be colored, the coloring matter in fine powder should 7 between the bars where it will be incorporated with the rubber as it passes between the bars and the cylinders. A revolving apron is attached to the ma; I chine which carries the rubber between the two cylinders, or a plank may be substituted if placed nearly in contact with the underside of the small cylinder, and the rubber put on in contact with the cylinder. The operation of the foregoing apparatus is as followsrThe' rubber is first cut into pieces about two inches square and from one eighth to one fourth of an inch thick, it is r then spread upon the apron that conveys it to the cylinder'where the compound rolling and slipping action of the heated cylinders softens and tears the rubber into fine threads, or thin sheets whi'chat the same time'mixes with the coloring which is sifted into the spaces between the bars, thus it I number them one, two, three, and-four, be- ginning at the bottom. No. l, iseighteen inches in diameter, Nos. 2, and 3, are each one foot in diameter, and No. 4:, is eighteen No. 3, moves -much slower than the others, thus creating a compound, rolling, and slipping action between the surfaces of No. 2, and N0. 3, and also between No. 3, and No. 4. Sometimes the three first cylinders only are used, in which case the gearing for driving the fourth cylinder is disengaged, and the cloth orother article to be coatedis made to pass into the covering machine between. the 2nd, and 3d, cylinders, thence it passes half around the 2d, and 1st, cylinder, the rubber side coming in contact with the first, and passing nearly around it, whence it is taken off and rolled up. The prepared rubber is conveydibyhand, or otherwise from the preparing part of the machine while warm, u ' and put into the hopper which is placed becomes in contact with the cloth, which warms and softens it so that it will adhere better to the cloth to which also the rubber is presented more uniformly than when promiscuously put into the hopper. I sometimes put the prepared rubber directly upon the cloth, or other'article to be covered be tween the 2d, and 3d, cylinders, and then disengage the gearing of the third cylinder, which will not then revolve. The bottom of the hopper in this case does not enter so far between the cylinders. The sides of the hopper must in all cases enter as far as possible without being pinched by the cylinders, to which they must be well fitted. Another mode of using this machine is as follows: The rubber alone enters between the 2d, and 3d, cylinders where it is formed into a sheet which passes half around the 2d, the cloth entering at the same time between the 2d, and 1st, where the sheet of rubber is transferred fromthe cylinder to the cloth then passing nearly around the first cylinder, where it is taken off and rolled up as before. In coloring I sometimes make the rubber into sheets, apply the coloring, and roll the same into a mass, and then pass it through the cylinders, repeating until sufliciently colored. Again I mix the coloring with small pieces of rubber, and let .them both go between the cylinders, or cylinder, and bars togethermix more, and repeat until sufliciently colored. When it goes between a bar and cylinder, or between two cylinders, one going faster than the other, the rubber comes through in fine particles so long as the coloring is added. The machine is an entire one although in the drawings herewith for the purpose of exhibiting more distinctly the several parts, and operations it is divided into sections Nos. 1, and 2, and Nos. 3, and 4. Figure 1, is the coating part of the ma chine, and a perspective view of it 6X- hibited in the drawing annexed A A A. A A A is a cast iron frame or housing for the rollers or cylinders.

In Fig. l, Sheet l, A, A, is the standard frame in which the working parts of the machine are fixed for use, shown as if of wood, but may be of iron. a, a, are two metal slides with hollow inner edges in which the wood or metal bed B, travels, and which is retained down, and guided by being screwed on a metal frame Zn, b, whose outer edges are beveled to fit, and move in the hollows in the edges of the slides a, a, at one end a wood, or metal upright, or head stock frame, c, c, is attached to the lower frame Zn, Z), having two slots in the vertical arms, at the opposite end of the frame Z), is the vertical, or tail stock frame d, having also long slots in the vertical arms, and connecting the two frames c, and d, is the holding down or keeper piece 0, and keeper screws, and slide nut e, working through a slot in c. Attached to each of the frames c, and d, is a bent carrier bar f, f, so fitted by Ynuts and screws through the slots in the frames 0, and el, that the bars f, f, may be secured at any required height. Upon the side of the frame c, is jointed one end of the holding lever g, having a hook whereon hangs a weight, and at the opposite end, upon the standard frame a, in front, and in a right line from the head stock frame are two short vertical standards D, D, on the exterior sides of the standards D, D, is the gage slide, and stop z' regulated by screws going through slots into the standards D, D, and shawn in sections in the detached Fig. 5. On the interior sides of the standards D, D, are two slide pieces j, j, screwed through slide slots on the standards D, D, and fitted to carry the sliding horizontal mandrel frame le, and Z, with its pulley, or drum m, which mandrel slide is moved by the lever n whose fulcrum is below on one standard D, and which lever has a slot to receive a stud on the mandrel frame 7,5, by which the lever moves the frame in either direction. Upon the lower horizontal part of the standard frame A, opposite the standards D, D, is a swinging frame E, the lower part of which is joined to the standard frame ground piece, andthe upper part is fitted with bearings O, O, to receive the mandrel, or arbor p, on one end of which is the driving drum F, and on the other end the circular saw G, which is directed to the required cut or withdrawn therefrom by the hand lever g, the arc of the motion being limited by the regulating, or keeper bar r, fixed at the head of one of the standard posts A, which post is made of an extra length for this, and for other purposes hereinafter explained, and the machine as thus far described is to be used as follows. Then it is desirable to saw a log of wood into the proper thickness for making sheaves, the log is to be placed in the hollow of the bed B, and supported at either end by the carrier bars f, f, and held down either by the lever g and its weight, or by the keeper screw e, from the keeper piece ff, or both as may be needed, and with very crooked pieces, wedges, 0r chocks may also be required. The gage slide z', is being regulated so that the required thickness of sheave may constitute the distance between the gage head and the saw, the bed B is to be pushed up by hand until the end of the log touches, and is stopped`V by the gagehead 2'. The workman then the saw lever g, forces the saw toward the log, and saw having motion. given'by a band or belt on the pulley F, which is connected in any usual mode to a first moving power will rapidly saw ofi the sheaves as required. 1When itis ldesired to saw out pins. for sheaves, the material is to be first cut from yals the log into proper lengths in the same manner as the sheaves as above described, and then the screw clamp H, and its bearing plate S, shown in the detached Fig. 2, which are all fitted for the purpose are to be laid into the frame upon the bent carrier bars f, f, and the pieces to be formed into pins are successively placed and screwed by the screw Q, into the clamp, and the gage head c' being regulated with ,saw to the size of the pin wanted, the operation of sawing out the pins is performed with the saw precisely as herein before described for sawing the sheaves, only that when the wood is sawed into thicknesses, it has to be sawed again to form a piece of square wood whose side shall be the diameter of the pin. When it is intended to bore the rough sheave for the pin hole, the traveling bed B, and all its frames and attendant fixtures are entirely removed by slipping it endwise out of the slide pieces a, a, and off the standard frame A, A, and the saw is thrown out of gear in any usual mode, and the two part slidingr bed I, shown detached in Fig. 8, is substituted for it. The lower part of this frame l, is fitted to work on the slide pieces a, a, and is to be stopped at any required point by a wedge, or block behind, and between it, and the movable sheave davit c, (shown by dotted lines on the plan). The upper part of the frame 2, slides on the lower part having the head block 3, on the lower frame 1, between the ends, and across the length of the frame 2, and the upper part of the frame 2, is connected to the mandrel frame R, by the strap lV, at the head end, and passed around the next bar of the mandrel frame and at the tail end a cord going over the upper part of the movable sheave davit fa, and under by the lower sheave over the sheave in the bumpkin davit connects the upper part of the frame 1, and leads now to the treadles y, and the operation of these last described parts is as follows. The workman places the rough sheaves in the clamps formed between the head stock 3, and the head end of the frame 2, and then pressing his foot on the treadles y compresses and holds it firmly there with the center opposite the drill in the mandrel Z, then with the w, moves the mandrel. frame R up toward the sheave, and rapid rotary motion being given by a belt over the drum mi, by any first mover, the drill enters, and makes the pin hole, and when a round bush is used the drill is made so as to form the required countersink. lVhen this is done the workman moves the lever back, and removes his foot from the treadle at the same time, thus opening the chops between the frames. The strap fw, as the mandrel frame moves drawing the frame 2 with it, the sheave then drops out below, leaving the chops open for others in succession to be inserted, and operated upon in the same way, and in the same manner any description of boring for other operations on block sheaves within the size of the machine may be separately effected. Y Vhenever it may occur that larger sheaves are required from this machine any increased size of cross-cut, sawing may be effected thereby within the size of the machine by laying the material either upon the main frame, upon the front, or upon the bench board 4, at the back of the saw, in either case the material may be held by a pointed lever, the point being inserted into poles in metal plates not shown lin the drawing, but which may be made in the long standard post shown in the drawing of the machine to which this specification refers below where it is marked A, 1. Upon the bench board 4, is the shifting gage stop 5, to measure any required length of material to v be cut, and connected by a bar 6, to the saw frame. The vertical swinging balance lever 7, having a weight at the upper and lower ends will assist the workman to swin the saw frame E, in or out as may be needed. When it is required to saw short pieces of wood into sheaves, a pair of chops made of metal, shown detached in Fig. 4, whose lower part forms a horizontal T standard may be placed on the traveling bed B and secured down by a block under the keeper screw e, so that the T piece 7% may be held under it. The piece to be operated on may now be placed on the chops 8, 8, which are to be regulated by the gage pin 9, and the piece to be held b the screw 10, so as to be cut up to a very sliort length of wood. The bed B, and the slide gage z', being used exactly as is before described, when used without this auxiliary apparatus. In cases where from the form ofthe piece, or from other causes it may be desirable to saw up still shorter lengths of material, the apparatus K, shown detached Fig. 6, may be used as follows: The metal plate 11, is prepared so that it may be fitted, and screwed securely on one side to the end of the gage slide z'. On the other side is the metal claw piece 12, having teeth on its outer edge. Above this the movable metal claw 13, is jointed to the face of the plate 11, and fitted with teeth in the same way, and with a long lever beyond the joint reaching outside the plate 11. By a cord ascending to a pulley, and descending from the pulley to a treadle, the workman can with the pressure of one foot on the treadle hold securely any short piece of material between the claws with one end close to the face of the plate 11, and this being adjusted so that the distance from the face of the plates to the saw is the same as the thickness of material required to be cut. The other end of the piece may be steadied by one hand of the workman, while with the other hand he brings up the saw to the material and cuts it as required. The machine being used with this last auxiliary part in all other respects as heretofore described and set forth.

18,,,"Description ATENT f GFFICE.' UNITED STATES THOMAS BLANCHARD, OI NEW YORK, N. Y. MACHINE FOR COUNTERSINKING TO RECEIVE BUSHES IN THE SHEAVES OF SHIPS TACKLE-BLOCKS. Specificationv of Letters Patent No. 18, dated August 31, 1836. T all whom it may concern Be it known-that I, THOMAS BLANCHARD, late of Springfield, inthe county of Hampden and State of Massachusetts, but now of thecity, county, and State of New York, have invented, made, and applied to use certain new and useful Improvements in Methods ofy Cutting `in or Countersinking Metal or other Bushes in the Sheaves for Ships Tackle-Blocks, and the said improvements and the machinery by which I effect the same are detailed and set forth in the following description, which refers to the drawings hereunto annexed and making part of speeiication,wherein The drawing Figure 1,7eXhibits an orthographic perspective plan of a machine for bushing sheaves, and the detached gures are Orthographie projections of detached parts shown more clearly, and representations of the alterations or additions required to effect the cutting in, or countersinking the same in other ways by certain shifting, or changeable parts whose uses are hereafter described, and the same letters andfigures of reference apply to the same parts in all the figures so far as they are alike in their forms, and uses. A, A, are the standard frame, and legs on which the machinery is'fiXed, represented as of wood, but may be ofV iron, two of which legs rise above the frame, and are connected by a lintel, or head piece at their upper ends. B, B, is a fixed platform bed of wood, or iron on which the required work is to be performed. C, is a shifting or traveling platform of wood, or iron supported at one end by the iron arbor a, the two ends of which arbor, have their bearings in the roller wheels b, b, and these travel each on a railway of metal c, C, secured on the main frame if of wood, or rising out of the same if metal, as may be"" most convenient. At the opposite end of the platform C, is a handle d, for the purpose of lifting the platform, and a guide piece e, having an eye in the outer end in which eye is the guide bar f, whose foot is a universal joint in the point of the bracket piece g, whose operation is shown in the detached figures 5, 6, and 7. In the middle of the platform C, toward the roller wheels is a pair of small carriages h, forming the bearings of the arbor z', to which arbor is secured one end of the metal mold plate, or apron stock D, which has a handle j, at the opposite end, under the platform bed B, is the lever bar K, whose fulcrum is on the standard post, A1. In the middle part of this lever is the gage shaft Z, standing vertically under a metal slide plate in the lower side of the platform C, and the shaft being jointed to the lever bar K, is long enough to slide its lower part in the cross bar m, and is to be adjusted by a pair of two part cross nuts, a, a, below the cross bar y, each on a screw thread cut on the gage shaft l, by which the ascent of the shaft is regulated in the working as shown in the detached Fig. 8. The lever bar lc, has a weight p, at the farther end which causes it to ascend as high as the nuts in the gage shaft will allow, and the operation of this lever bar, f, is again regulated by the two part spring latch Q g, whose lower end is jointed to the bar 7c, and the upper end goes through the staple ring 1, and when the operation of the weight j), is not needed the latch is forced down so lthat the catch of the latch takes below the staple ring, and puts the weight p, out of use. The mold stock D, is so made that a set of templet mold plates l, l, l, to surround the required bush can be screwed down upon it, in such a way that when the machine is at a rest the center of the templet mold shall be vert-ical or in the same line with the center of the middle stud pin 3, which is made to shift into, and out of a round hole through the platform C, into the metal plate over the head of the gage shaft Z, and thus allow a metal pin to be placed o-n whose head may be of any required size to fit the bore'in the sheave which is to be bushed. Immediately above this is a cutting or countersinking bit t, whose form is shown on a larger scale by thedetached Fig. 3, and in end section in Fig. 9, which bit works vertically in the stock, or vertical arbor c, having a steel guide piece above. The guide piece being the same diameter as the cutting bit the shaft of which passes through the guide piece, and is secured into the lower end of the arbor by a set screw, the arbor is maintained in place by two vertical bearings u, u, one in the lintel head of the main frame, and one on the stretcher, or girt piece W, on which stock, or arbor is the drum, or pulley X, to receive a band by which very rapid rotary motion may be given to the bit t, from any prime mover. The method of using this machine so far as the same is thus described in bushing sheaves is as follows: The metal center stud 3 of the same size as the hole through the sheave which is to be bushed is first placed, the rough sheave is then put down with the stud 3 through the pin hole, the sheave being under the metal mold stock D. The workman attending now grasps the handles d and with his right hand by which he holds the sheave firmly between the platform C and the mold stock D and with his left hand holds and moves the uide bar p and platform C and mold stock l) so as to bring every part of the sheave not covered by the teinplet mold pieces screwed on the mold stock D in rapid succession under the bit t which enters into the wood material and removes so much as is required to form the cavity or countersink space for the flanches of the bush. The edge of the opening being formed by the steel guide piece above named running in contact with the inner edges of the teinplet molds and the depth to which the bit is to cut being regulated by the ascent of the gage shaft C a hole is thus countersunk of the required depth, and exactl of the same form as the templet mold, wliich form being the same as the flanch of the bush that side of the sheave is thus prepared for the workman to place the bush into a counter-sink accurately fitted to receive it. Vhen the bushes are cast not all precisely alike in shape or fullness of parts these differences are to be overcome and allowed for in countersinking to receive the flanches of the bush by removing the templet plates l, l, l, and substituting the gig plates 2 for them. These are represented in the detached plate, Fig. 2, as affixed to a metal mold stock F prepared to receive them and attached to the arbor z' in place of the mold stock D. On the face of this mold plate F are four studs over which the keeper plates 4, 4, are placed so as to confine the gig plates 2, 2, to any required point by the operation of thumb nuts 5, 5, upon the screw shafts 6, 6, and these shifted or changed parts are to be used as follows: The workman-places the sheave with the barrel of the bush in the hole prepared for it in the sheave upon the metal center stud 3 and then adjusts the interior edges of the gig plates 2, 2, 2, to the outer edges of the bush, then places a pair of reverse, or as they are technically termed Lewis tongs, into the hole in the bush and compressing the arms of the tongs the expansion of the points jams them in the hole and enables the workman to remove the bush. He then countersinks the sheave by bringing the counter-sink bit t into work precisely as herein before described for doing so by the common templet pieces. The workman can use the bit shown in detached Fig. 3 first described and which is in the form of an S, having two cutting lips, or in form of a C, having one cutting lip the form of which is shown in detached Fig. 4, as may be found best according to the quality of the wood to be operated upon; or the third bit formed of a round shaft having a cavity to receive `a lip of hardened steel on one side, which lip has a flat end and is secured 'by a collar and set screw into place in the bit, as shown in the detached Fig. E, may be brought into operation and any other description of countersinking for these purposes may be performed in the same manner by similar bits, gigs, templet plates, and templet molds fitted to act in conjunction to produce the effect required in the manner and on the principle herein before substan tially described and set forth. And I, the said THOMAS BLANCHARD, do hereby declare that l claim as my invention- The formation of the bit first described herein and the movable entering lip of the bit last described and the application of the same to countersinking the bushes of block sheaves in conjunction with the apron plates, templet plates, or pieces and gig plates, or pieces, and countersinking molds as here-in substantially set forth and described and ap plicable to countersinking the sheaves of blocks to receive the bushes all which in combination and in their application constitute my improvements in the method of effecting the objects in view. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand July 26, 1836. THOS. BLANCHARD. Witnesses: J oHN C. GoDDARD, 7. SEVRELL."

To aZZ 'whom it may concern Be it known that I, THOMAS BLANCHARD, lat-e of Springfield, inthe county of Hampden and State of Massachusetts, but now of the city, county and State of New York, have invented, made, and applied to use certain new and useful improvements in machinery for making ships tackle and pulley blocks, which machinery is applicable to forming or shaping the sides of blocks the shells of which are made in pieces and conveniently known as plank or made blocks, as distinguishable by'such name from common 'or' solid shell blocks, and that the said machinery and the method of constructing and using the same are correctly and fully set forth and shown in the following description and in the drawing annexed to and forming a part of this specification, wherein is shown an orthographical perspective of the' machine, Figure 1, in which- A, A, are two lower bearers, B, B, are two short posts, or legs supporting c, c, o, three pieces forming a frame on which the working parts of the machineryi are mounted, and which at one end joint into D, D, two other standard posts or legs, these .are shown in the drawing as of wood but may be made of iron. Between ,the legs B, B, is fixed the swing frame E, mounted on centers, o-r pivots going through the end pieces into the frame B, B, and supported by the steady frame F, towhich it is jointed by the bars al, a, and ears b, Z), and the direct motion of these two frames is given by the crooked lever C, whose fulcrum is fixed on the frame e, the lever being jointed by the bar CZ, to one side of the frame E. Between the two upper parts of the frame E, is fixed the block e, mounted on centers which come through the frame E, and having a wide flanch on the end next the lever C. Behind this block e is the plate f, and at right angles to this are the posts or standards Zt, h, and centrically upon the plate f and between the standards it, Zt', is fixed the conical shaft i, held in place by bearings g, g, upon the outer end of the shaft z', is the forked carriage y', and between the points of this fork the swing center plate K, is mounted on a pivot or center at each end centrically in this swing center plate is a pair of flanches on each edge sofitted that they stand out at rightangles to, and lengthwise parallel with the edges of the plate k. lThe two adjusting plates Z Z are fitted in the same manner with fianges behind them and are mounted on the plate Zu, by screw centers, which go through the flanches of the plates Z, Z, into the fianches of the plate le, and the distances of the ends of the adjusting plates Z, Z, from the face of the pla-te Za, are regulatedby set screws in the swing plate lo. Upon the face of the adjusting plates Z, Z, are 'fitted the cheek plates m, m, so xed by screws that they may be removed, and give place to larger or smaller plates when needful. Each end of the cheek plates M, M, is turned up to form a permanent nut through which four holding screws, n, n, n, a, are, fitted to work either with center points or to spur plates for the purpose hereafter described. The clutch lever 0, is mounted in center working into a pair of cross arms on the lever from the standard posts L, 71. This lever is formed with a T head on the under side of which at each end is one of the clutch plates p, p, having flanches by which they are screwed onto the T head of the lever through slotsv in the head which allow of these clutch plates being adjusted at` any required distance from the center of the lever o. These parts are shown in orthographic projection in a front view, in the. fitted to receive the heads of the screw vcenters n, m, n, n, and turn them in or outy of the nuts on the ends of the plates m, m, upon the frame Z, Z. In front'of the last described parts are two standards G, Gr, connected by a lintlshead, and between these standards the rotary cutter shaft H, is lullig on centers, and has mounted on it four cutter stocks g, g, g, g, each having fixed upon it a cutter' blade with a curved edge, the stock and cutters being fixed at right angles to the shaft and diagonally to cut at a similar angle to that of a carpenters plane iron. `On one end of the cutter shaft H is the drum on pulley I, to give a rapid rotary motion tothe cutters by a belt, or band from any first movingpower, and the-method of using this machine as thus far described, is as follows. A piece of plank to form the side of a block having been cut into a rough form and planed on the part intended to go inside is placed by the workmen between the two nuts on the ends of the cheek plates m, m, while the plates are laid horizontally by turning the fork The workman then enters the screw centers a, n, into the ends of the wood by the aid of the brace 7, then rolls the spring and check plates round on the center in the fork to put a second piece in on the opposite side in the same manner. Having done this he set-s the fork vertically under the clutch plates p, p, under the end of the lever; the stop pieces s, s, on the sides of the fork come against the lever 0, preventing the apparatus from rolling too far on the conical joint z', and the guide piece t aids in bringing down the lever o, so that the clutch plates p, p, come tightly down one on each side over the adjusting plates Z, Z, and the lever having a click stud which takes into the ratchet teeth in the vertical spring bar u. The workman by lifting the Outer end of the lever fixes the whole apparatus so firmly that Yit can only move toward the cutters on the lower center of the swing frame E, with a llimited motion on the centers of the joint block e. In this direction the workman now by the lever c, makes the whole approach the cutters (j, Q, which are to be in rapid rotation, and they will now cut the middle part and edge of each wooden cheek piece to their Own shape as they revolve. The form board u, on the fianch of the joint block e, now comes in contact with the guide board w, shown in the detached Fig. 4, and the workman depressing the clutch lever 0, the compound curve formed by moving with the edges of the form board and guide board in contact will bring the apparatus and wooden checks' upward in such a direction that the cutters will finish the lower and forward quarters of each pair of cheeks in the required form. The Operation of these cutters being such that they cut diagonally from the grain of the wood operated on so as to make a drawing stroke, or cut by which the work is at once finished with a smooth surface, and by the set screws on'the plate K. The plates Z, Z, are allowed to be drawn in at top by the clutch plates p', j), so as to let out the Opposite ends of the cheeks for the cutters to cut the ends thinner than the middle of the cheek, and by these conjoined adjustments the cheeks are formed in the proper curves both transverse and lengthwise as the same are required to give a finished form to the side of the block. The workman then withdraws the apparatus from the cutters, and disengages the lever 0, from the ratchet bar fu, and raises the clutch platesI so as to turn the cheeks, and apparatus upon the center of the swing plate, and present the Opposite lower quarters of the cheek to the cutters, then securing the whole by the clutch plates, lever, and ratchet bar, he repeats the motion above described, and thereby the second lower quarter of the wooden cheeks is cut to form. IAIe then withdraws as before, and disengages the lever and clutch plates, and turns the forked carriage j end for end on its conical shaft z', and again repeats the previously described Operations, thereby cutting successively the four quarters of each ch'eek into a precisely similar form. These are then taken out by reversing the operation by which they have been placed in successively to be formed for use in a similar manner. And I, the said THOMAS BLANCHARD, do hereby declare that I claim as my inventionl. The application of rotary cutters in the form hereinbefore described to the purpose of shaping the cheeks of plank blocks. 2. And I also claim as my invention the combination of mechanical means for fixing and holding block cheeks, and presenting the same to the operation of the cutters as hereinbefore substantially described and set forth, by which such cheek pieces are cut without being moved from the machine into the form and curves required on a cheek piece of a finished block.

21,,,"Description WILLIAM MORSE, OF CORINNA, MAINE. GRANITE-MACHINE FO R DRESSING OR HAMMERING. Specification of Letters Patent No. 21, dated September 5, 1836; the said improvement as invented by me. The machine works in an oblong square frame, which for working a piece. of granite ten feet in length may be of the following dimensions viz: two sills twenty-two feet in length, eight by ten inches square, placed three feet asunder, and connected at the ends by two cross sills. At the rear end, the ' cross end or end sill is framed on with the ends flush with the sides of the side sills; but the other end sill projects outward from the side sills about two feet, and on the ends of the last mentioned end sill are framed two other sills about four feet in length and eight by ten inches square, the other ends of these sills are connected by another sill of the same size. The two first mentioned sills serve as bed pieces for a railway which the carriage works, on the upper side of the bed pieces, and near the inward sides are two iron railway pieces extending the .whole length of the bed pieces, and projecting or rising one inch above them the upper sides of the railway pieces are brought to an edge by a double bevel. On this railway a number of pieces of cast iron rollers sufficient to sustain the pressure 'of the load on the carriage, are fitted to work. The rollers are connected in pairs by suitable iron axle trees. The axle trees are kept at their proper distance from each other by a girder which is attached to them at the center of their length. Their carriage is a plank of wood eight to ten feet in length, of suitable thickness, and the width corresponding to the length of the axle trees. To guide the carriageo-n the rollers suitable cleats are attached to the under side, and extending the whole length of the plank so as to admit the rollers to work within themthe carriage must not come in contact with the axle trees but then must rest entirely on the rollers. To strengthen the carriage suitable cross cleats are attached to the upper side of it extending the whole width of the plank. The construction of the frame is further effected by erecting two posts on the side sills or bed pieces about ten feet from the rear end, and two other like post-s framed into the end sill which connects the other ends of the bed pieces. These two pair of posts are connected at the top, or upper ends, by framing a beam on each pair. These beams are connected by two plates framed int-o the beams by suitable tenons on the ends of the plates, and corresponding mortises in the beams. The plates may be about five by seven inches square, and they are supported by the two studs under each, the lower ends of. which are framed into the bed pieces, opposite the posts which are connected at the above described projection and on the last described end sill, are erected two other posts which extend about sixteen inches higher than those before described. These posts are connected with the other pairs, by framing in a suitable girth on each side with tenons on the girths, and mortises on the posts, these girths are inserted a little below the beams. square, and extending from the last described posts to the rear beam are fitted with gudgeons in the ends that work in the posts, and the beams. In the center of the space between the high posts, is a tapped wheel 'four feet in diameter the shaft of which extends horizontally, from one post to the other with gudgeons on the ends that work in boxes Two shafts four inches"" which are attached to the outside of the posts at a height corresponding to the elevation of the above named shafts, the area circumference to the center, and the wheel is perforated through at all these lines, about one inch from the circumference. In these perforations suitable pins are inserted projecting out about two inches, half of the projections on one side, and half on the other in regular rotation. The end of the hammer handles are confined in 'the above described shafts, their number being from two to five on a side according to the width of the iece of granite to be worked. The length of the handles of the first, or rear hammers is such as to bring the hammers in contact when they are both at rest, on the plate. The length of the second hammer handles is three inches or the width of the hammer shorter than the first, and'so on through the whole series. The elevation of the shafts above the plate is such as to allow the hammer handles to fall level on the plates, as the handles of the first pair of hammers overreach the plates, two timbers are framed into the plates, and beam in the form of braces. The hammers are operated by means of arms, 5 one of which isattached to each of the are raised by means of the pins, and consequently the hammers are raised, till the arms drop from the pins, and the hammers fall upon the granite, ' To move the carriage a shaft is extended from one of the middle posts to the other and on the ends of this shaft are gudgeons, which work in boxes, attached to the sides of the posts, and on the ends of this shaft just Within the posts are two ratchet wheels about sixteen inches in diameter which are operated by means of hands that are at tached to the ends of twocompound double levers the upper end of one part of which is connected by pins to the above described arms, and the other part is connected with the posts, by pins whichpass through them at the center of their length into the posts, the last mentioned answering the purpose of'fulcrums. The carriage is connected to the last described shaft, by a chain or other suitable connective, and as the ratch wheel shaft winds up the chain the granite on the carriage is passed under the hammers. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is- The'combination of two rows of hammers placed on opposite sides of the frame operated by one tappet wheel. Y WILLIAM MORSE.

FICK- ARDT, of the borough of Easton, in the county of Northampton, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Furnaces for Supplying Upper Rooms with Heated Air, and that the following is a full and exact description thereof, to-wit: A, first chamber of such size, shape and proportions `as may at any time be deemed most eligible for the purposes intended towit: containing the stove, and body of air sufficient in its passage for conveying heat enoughl to the rooms, the chamber to be made of tin, or other reflecting material, and having a sloping top, terminating in a central tube, or flue, but to have no bottom, the whole resting on a suflicient number of feet, said feet to be three, or four inches high, thus leaving a void beneath its edge for the entrance of air in a manner hereafter to be described, secondly, a seco-nd, or outer chamber made of similar, or other reflecting material large enough to surround the first chamber so as to leave a void between their respective opposing surfaces say of one, two, or three inches for the travel of the air to be heated, Snc. This second chamber to have a sloping top, and a tube, the tube to be short say three, or four inches, but both so to correspond with those of the` first, or inner chamber, as to leave a void between for the admission of the air equal, and continuous with the void just described, the whole void together forming a passage for the external air between the bodies of the inner, and outer chambers, and underneath the edge of the inner one, where of course after having intercepted the heat escaped through lthe first reflector it comes in contact with the stove, or other apparatus used for generating heat, and passes up through the tube o-f the inner chamber, and from thence it is conducted to the rooms. This second chamber, will stand on a level with the bottom of the feet of the first chamber, and should have an air tight, or nearly air tight bottom, or be otherwise suitably arranged, or the plan for the current of air may be altered so as to leave the opening for the entrance of eX- ternal air at the bottom of the void above described, and (closing that above of course) to have also by means of an aperture in the top, or tube of the inner chamber the communication for the outer, and inner drafts above; both the first and second chambers may have doors situated so as to correspond for the purpose of feeding the stove, Sac. The tube of the inner, or first chamber will move over in the case of the first plan which is set forth in the drawings, and model be furnished with a sliding lid, or cover to fit clos-elyV over the mouth of the tube of the outer chamber, and thereby when occasion requires to close that aperture against the entrance of external air from the cellar, Sac. Lastly the whole outer surface, of the outer chamber as well as when convenient of the outer surface of the tubes may be covered with a coating of coarse woolen, or other fabric of like pliable, and as it regards heat, non-conducting nature such coating if thought desirable to be previ# ously prepared, by solutions, or mixtures of soap, and alum, &c., to a higher degree of non-conducting power as aforesaid, the preparation of such coating as aforesaid, to consist in one, or more immersions in a strong solution of alum, &c. immersions, and subsequent dryings following alternately, or in the use of soap alone, or of a mixture of soap, and alum, or alum water, the miX- 1 ture to be of same consistency in either case, the ingredients tobe well incorporated with the body of the coating aforesaid. n What I claim as my own invention, and not previously known in the above described furnace is 1. The employment of two successive reflecting chambers as above described for the purpose of throwing back, and retaining the radiated, andother heat coming in contact with them. 2. The employment of an outer reflecting chamber, when in combination with an inner chamber reflecting, or otherwise, by the terni outer, I mean outer with regard to the interior one. 3.

24,,,"Description STATES PATENT' OFFICE. DAVID CLARK, OF BROOKLYN, CONNECTICUT. IVIORTISING-MACHINE. Specification of Letters Patent No: 24:, dated September 14, 1836. 'following is a full and exact description thereof. Itake a piece of joist 3 feet long, across each end of which I frame another piece, two feet long, forming the foundation. In the center of this first piece, I place a joist perpendicular six feet long braced from the foundation. Two feet from the foundation I fasten with an Viron bolt a piece of plank two feet long, and eight or nine inches wide crosswise of the perpendicular joist, and edgewise of the plank for a platform for a carriage to run upon. In the center of this platform on the underside I frame a short piece of joist, through which I place a lever about five feet long moving on a pin through this short piece of joist passing through a mortise in the perpendicular joist, and extending back of it one foot, the remainder of it coming forward near the end of which the hand, the hand is applied, to operate the machine by moving it up, and down, on each side of this lever, about three, or four inches from it, and underneath the platform I place a roller which is turned around by means of a dog acting on a ratchet wheel attached, to the front end of the roller; one half the lengths of these rollers is turned smaller than the other, in order that the cord which moves the carriage may be transferred from one part to the other to increase, or decrease the feed as the case may require. To do this more readily the cord is attached close to the end of the larger part so that by cutting a notch from it to the smaller it will wind on either part without difficulty. To move these rollers I made a dog with a joint in it, which I place on the front of the platform in such position that the joint will come directly over the lever, and a little be low the platform when it hangs in its natural position, so that when the lever is raised it will hit the joint, straighten the dog, and force the ratchet wheel forward which is kept in place by a small dog placed over it. This rst dog turns on a-pin without a head and is kept on it by a wire bent to a right angle, one part of which is kdriven into the front of the platform, so that the other will turnl directly over the dog. Anotherpin and wire isso placed that the same dog will operate upon the other ratchet wheel in the same manner when reversed. Y The lower part of `this dog'isfkept in placeby a guard passing across the outside of both parts of it. I make a carriage of a piece of a piece of plank to correspond with the platform, but enough narrower to admit of guides at the edges to keep it in place. At each edge of this carriage are two studs, through which, screws pass to'regulate the piece to be mortised. In the under side of the carriage in the center, and 4from end to end I plow a groove of suflicient width, and depth to admit a small cord, attached in the middle, and passing over each end of the platform, on a pulley winds around the rollers before described to move the carriage either way. Above the carriage I place a slide of wood, or iron with a mortise through it which is Vregulated by a screw through the mortise entering the perpendicular joint, and is raised, or lowered as required, to prevent the piece to be mortised from rising, when the chisel is withdrawn. One foot above the carriage I fasten by screws, or otherwise a box, and six inches above that, another. These boxes stand out from the perpendicular joist, 4three and a half inches to the center of the aperture, this aperture is square one corner coming in front. The boxes are divided from corner to corner, and are tightened, or loosened by screws. A piston passes through these boxes an inch, and a half square, and eighteen, or twenty inches long, in the lower end of which I have either a round or square socket for the chisel, a little tapering with a hole drilled near the top for the purpose of starting it out. In the upper end of the piston I place a pulley four inches in diameter. Just upon the upper box I place a hook to which I attach one end of a chain, or rope passing over the pulley in the top of the piston downward, and attached to the lever, by an iron going both sides of the lever, through which and the lever a pin is passed; I have likewise extra holes both in the iron, and lever to raise or lower the piston, on the ends of the pins passing through the center of the pulley, and the top of the piston is a clevis to the curve of which I attach another chain, or rope passing over a pulley (the surface of which must be directly over the center of the piston) in the top of the perpendicular joint, and down on the back side Where it is attached to the lever in the same manner as the other chain, or rope. Vhat I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent is l. The application of the power, bv means, or lever moving on a fulcrumbeneath the platform; a chain, or rope from the lever in 'front passing over a pulley in the top* of the piston, and attached to the perpendicular j oist, and the mode of raising the piston, by a chain, or rope attached at the top of the piston passing over a pulley at the top of the perpendicular joist, downward, and attached to the back end .of the lever.

25,,,"Description 1 UNrrED STAWENT oFFroE. JONATHAN HOBBS, JR., OF FALMOUTH, MAINE. MACHINE FOR SAWING SHINGLES. description. 1. I make the bed frame, on which I placel the operating parts of the machine in the following manner, I lay down a cross sill at each end fifty two inches long of 6 by 8 timber. 2. The ends of the front, and rear side pieces or sills are laid on the ends of these cross sills, the front sill is 3, by 8, and the back sill is 8, by 8. 3. Near each end I place a pair of friction rollers, for the carriage to travel on, eleven inches in diameter, of proper thickness the edges turned to a miter, each pair is on one shaft. The back roller is made thick enough to have a whirl for a small band, on the inside of it. 4. Four feet from the left ends of the sills I frame in a cross sill; and two feet farther, in the clear, to the right I frame in another cross sill 8 by 8. 5. On these two cross plates I lay two timbers lengthwise of the frame (No. 1,) of suflicient strength, on which I hang the circular saw. These timbers are about sixteen inches apart, and placed toward the back side of the frame. 6. On the back sill I set four posts 14 inches high, and 4, by 4. 7. On these posts I put a rail 2 inches by 6, and twelve feet long. 8. On the left end of this rail I put a block, 5 inches wide, and 7 high, and 5%- feet long. The right end of this block is scarfed, and makes one of the inclined planes. 9. Twenty-seven inches to the left I place a loose block on the top of the other having the right end scarfed, which makes the other inclined plane. This blocks is set on loose, with two dowel pins, and can be removed to the left endvv of the rail when used for sawing clap boards. When shingles are sawed, both inclined planes are used, and when clap boards are sawed, the left one only is used. 10. On the' back side, and near the right end, I hang a wheel or pulley about three feet diameter on a shaft about two feet long, on the outer end of the shaft I turn two whirls, on the inside of this wheel I make another wheel or pulley one, and a half foot diameter. These Vdierworking, and are moved by belt from the main drum. These two pulleys should hang very near the outside of the frame. A numL ber of plane iron or spoke shaves are placed on the inside of this wheel in the rim by which the shingles are edged, and jointed, being held in place by a hook, or pin. This is also called the j ointing wheel. 11. On the inner end of this shaft is a loose cylinder about siX inches long, and two diameter to go on loose en the shaft. This cylinder has a flanch, or rim, on the end next to the wheel two inches broad. This flanch vhas a pin in the side next the wheel which catches on to-n another pin in the wheel corresponding with it when the cylinder is pushed up against the wheel, and then it turns with the wheel, and winds a belt around it which is attached ent sizes are designed for different speeds in by the other end, to the piece on the `right/"" end of the carriage, and thereby runs the carriage back when the shingle is cut out, ready for the neXt cut. 12. On the left of this cylinder a knee is placed, one leg about siX inches long with a slot which meshes onto the flanch No. 11. `The other leg ex-y tends about eight inches passes vunder the carriage, and then turns up about four inches. This upright part of the knee is operated upon alternately by two pins stand# ing on the inside of the back side piece of the carriage, whereby the loose cylinder is meshed onto the wheel, and unmeshed by the pins aforesaid No. 11. When clapboards are sawed the right pin is moved about 28 inches to the right to accommodate the length of the log. This knee hangs on a pin at the angle. 18. About twenty inches from the left end of the back sill, I put in a roller about 6 inches long, and eight diameter, having a right hand screw, or spiral grooving, coarse thread, the l whole length. This screw runs off on the back end of this roller, and is. cut in, and makes halfa turn on` that end, and terminates at nearly the center. The use of this diminution is to bring the bolt, or log lightly against the saw when first beginning to out. Near the circumference of this roller, and against the termination yof the scroll I bore a dozen holes, or less, and put a pin into any one of them as occasion may require. length, and fasten one end of it to the l left back side pieces of the carriage, end of the 14. Then I takeV a line of proper and pass it twice around the roller, and then hang a weight to the other end below sufficient to carry the carriage forward to the cut. The piece aforesaid should be so placed that, when the carriage is hauled back, and the machine set for the next cut, the line should bear a little against this pin so as to start the carriage easy. Then when the line leaves the pin it hangs at the diminution of the scroll aforesaid which gives the weight a light power upon the carriage, when the saw first begins to cut, which increases as the roller turns forward, until it comes .to its full strength at the circumference. Any other method of carrying the bolt forward may be used if preferred. 15. At the right end of the back sill- I place a platform about 26 inchessquare; on this I set a sliding frame about 22 inches by 12, held in place by two wooden hooks standingover the sides. In this sliding frame I hang a whirl fifteen inches in diameter on a shaft about 21 inches long. This whirl stands in range with the whirl on the jointing wheel; on the other end of this shaft is a whirl corresponding with the one on the friction roller No. 3, a band passes varound this large whirl, and the whirl on the outer end of the shaft of the jointing wheel, and a cross band passes around the whirl on the friction roller, and the whirl on the other end of this shaft. In a line with the sides of the sliding frame about eight inches to the right I set two pins one inch indiameter from each side piece of the sliding frame, I attach a line to each pin. The use of these pins, and lines is by winding or unwinding these lines around these pins.' The bands on the whirls aforesaid can be tightened or loosened at pleasure. ThisY apparatus is called the regulator, 16, on the friction rollers aforesaid No. 3, I place the traveling carriage aforesaid about siXteen feet long, and three feet four inches wide. The side pieces 4: by 6, having ties or cross timbers about two feet from each end. At the right hand end I put a strip of board across running out at l the back side about 4 inches to which I fasten the belt having the other end fastened to the `loose cylinder No. 11. These side pieces are about three feet one inch apart in the clear. 17. Three feet nine `Ainches from the left end of the carriage I halve on a piece perpendicular two feet ten inches long 8 by 2. I call these pieces stirrups. These stirrups have each a short slot through which they are bolted onto the head, and tail blocks; each block has several holes, by which the stirrup can be raised, and lowered as well as by the slot. 20. On the tops of these stirrups I put a cap piece, having long` tenons passing up through the cap piece, and keys through each tenon over the cap piece. 21. In the center of this cap piece I pass a bolt up through it, and through a wooden spring. This spring reaches nearly the length of the cap piece, having two iron rods fastened into it which pass loose through two holes down into the rag wheels by which the setting for the shingles is performed. These pins are pressed down hard by the bolt on these rag wheels whereby the jaws are kept firmly in their places at each set, as the shingles are sawed. 22. At the lower end of each stirrup a plate of iron is riveted on the inside, and goes down below the wood far enough to admit a mortise one inch; the ends of the foot piece of the stirrup enter these mortises, whereby it is supported. The front corner of each of these plates is drawn to a hook turning outward. The use of these hooks is when sawing clapboard to pass a line around them and strain up with a lid after the manner of a wood saw, so as to hold the stirrups hard against the ends of the log so as to hold it firm in its place at each set for a board. 23. The foot piece of the stirrups is 6 by 2, reach between the stirrups, and having a tenon at each end passing through the mortise in the plate, at the bottom end of each stirrup. 24C. About 8 inches from each end cross pieces are riveted into the foot piece about twelve inches long, on which the shingle bolt rests when sawing. 25. At the left end of the foot piece of the stirrups, an iron Yplate by 4, is riveted, having several holes for the bottom gudgeon of the left shaft of the jaws to stand in, as occasion may require, to accommodate a long or short shingle bolt. Y 26. The jaw's that hold vthe bolt are made thus: taleV a rod of round iron, and 212` feet long. A hub about six inches by twoV is put fast on the lower end. These hubs are set with short sharp teeth which sink into the end of the bolt, and hold it fast; on the upper end of each shaft is arag wheelinches diameter. These wheels, on the edges are cut with eight sets of rags or notches, and every other one twice the length of the other, so as to set for the head, and point of a shingle alternately, as the bolt is sawed. The left jaw piece stands about six inches from the left stirrup piece, the lower gudgeon in one of the holes in the iron plate, and the upper gudgeon in an iron on the cap piece, the right jaw piece is set the lower gudgeon in one end of a knee, and the upper en d in the iron on the cap piece. These jaws stand about 19 inches apart. 27. The knee on which the right jaw piece stands' is afiat rectangular piece of iron, the inner end about seventeen inches long, and the outer one twenty-tive, this knee is hung at the angle on a pin; the longer leg runs to the lett inside of the front side piece of the carriage frame having the end drawn to a pin, and turned down through a hole, in a fiat piece of iron, which passes loose through a mortise in the front'side piece of the carriage. The lower gudgeon stands in the short end of this knee, and the upper gudgeon in the iron on the cap piece. On the under side of the cap piece I rivet on two fiat pieces of iron about 5,; inch wide, and 4 long, on the back side the upper gudgeons of the jaw pieces pass through these irons close to the cap pieces, and the upper end of the rod which holds up the right jaw piece of the right setter, passes up through the end of the fiat piece of iron on the front. 28. The fiat piece of iron which hitchesl on to the long leg of the knee, and passes through the side piece of the carriage, also passes loose through a mortise in a wooden spring on the front side of the carriage having several holes in the outer end, whereby it may be shortened, or lengthened by a pin, in some one of those holes. 29. This spring is of proper length, and strength, and is bolted on to the front side of the carriage. This spring as it is tightened or loosened by placing the pin in diHerent holes brings the right jaw up harder, or lighter as occasion requires in holding the bolt, when this spring is pushed in, it opens the jaws to receive the shingle bolt, and when the spring halts back it shuts the jaws up on the bolt and holds it fast. A like motion opens the jaws to take the bolt out if necessary. 30. The inner, or short end of this knee is held up by a small rod of iron passing through it with a nut pin or head on the under side, and the other end passing up through the iron on the cap piece aforesaid with a pin, or nut on the end. 3l. A pair of nippers takes hold of the outer edge of the bolt to keep it from canting. Each jaw end of these nippers is turned up to a round sharp po-int. The under arm of these nippers lies on the upperl side of the front side piece of the carriage, passing through a hole in a piece of iron on the front side of the carriage. It then turns up having notches on the edge into which the other arm catches to hold the bite ot the nippers. 32. The Setters which move the rag wheels on the upper ends of the shafts of the jaws, are made as follows: The setter on the head block is a knee, or right angular piece of iron, attached to the head block, 0n the inside, by a pin at the angle, having Lone leg reaching down from the angle about 18 inches and the other reaching back horizontally about 28 inches At the bottom end, a iat piece of iron 6 inches long is pinnedf on,- and the other end pinned on toy another flat bar of iron standing perpendicular, and parallel with the lower leg of the knee, it also passes up by the horizontal part ofthe knee, and is pinned on to the stirrup. This pin is about 2S inches long, and the upper end works on the lett rag wheel to set it. The outer end of the horizontal part of the knee, at the outer end is turned up with a quarter twist, which turns the fiat side. the.` other way, having a bolt hole through it. A iat piece of iron about ten inches longl having .a slot nearly the whole length .is bolted on by means of the slot; this piece.. 4can be set up, or down at pleasure. At the lower end of this piece a pin is riveted standing out Y about three inches, with a nut, or pin at the end. A trunk 4 inches in diameter is put on this pin. 33. The setter on the tail block is fastened on to the inside of the tail blo-ck by a pin at the angle. It is a rectangular knee like the other having one leg run up perpendicular about 18 inches, and the other running back horizontally about 28 inches. The upper end works on the right rag wheel in setting. The outer end of the horizontal part is made round, and a trunk put on it like the other. A line is passed from one either to the other loose, or to which a light weight is put which inclines the setters together, whereby they are kept up to the rag wheels so as not to make any mistake in setting. 34. Outside of theseV trucks, a rail is put on to their gudgeons, which keeps the trucks at equal distances at all times from each other. 35. A brace is slipped on to the gudgeon of the truck, on the setter attached to the head block by one end, and the other end is slipped on to a pin standing in the upper side of the tail block, at the back end. This brace keeps the setters, and trucks steady in their places as they run up, and down on the inclined planes, in performing the operation of setting for the shingles as they are sawed. ' Whenever the machine is put in operation the rag wheels should be relatively so placed that one setter will set a short notch, when the other a long one, and then they will actuate continuously, in setting butts, and points of the shingles, and will never miss. Then when the saw has made a run, and the carriage has run back till the saw is clear of the bolt, the trucks mount the inclined planes, whereby the Setters operate upon the rag wheels, and set for the next shingle, and they will continually set alternately, a long notch, and a short one, whereby the butts, and the points of the shingles are changed alternately. ters for Working at the top instead of theV bottom; 4, the cap piece and the apparatus on the top of it; 5, the bed piece on Which .the bolt lies; 6, the difference in the construction of the head, and tail blocks, and the stirrups; 7 having the left saw stationary. 8.

MACHINE FOR MANUFACTURING SILVER SPOONS. Specification of Letters Patent No. 26, dated September 20, 1836. To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, J OSEPHUS BRooKwA'r, of the city of Troy, county of Rensselaer, and State of New York, have invented'a new and useful Improvement in the Making or Manufacturing of Silver Spoons, which invention and the manner of using it is as follows. 'This improvement in the manufacture of spoons consists in plating and cutting a bar of silver in the shape, thickness and just proportions of asp'oon by means of a mill in all its outlines precisely like a common platers mill. A common platers mill with eight inch rolls may be converted to this purpose, and as these are in common use, and well known, further description is deemed unnecessary. The drawing exhibits its appearance. The first operation of this mill is to take a bar of silver, about half an inch shorter than the spoon required. This must be rolled through widthwise, the bar of silver should be very little thicker than the thickest part of the spoonhandle required, and as wide as the handle at the shoulder. One end of this bar will then be placed directly over the center of the rise, or peen marked a, upon the upper roller, and the mill turned, and it will come through plated, and widened at one end in the shape of a spoon bowl, and at the other widened like the flat part of a spoon handle. The spoon bar is to be rolled through, and through, the screws put down at every turn until the bowl is sufliciently enlarged, and the handle brought to the proper thickness, or proportion of thickness. The handle in its entire length is left by this process, a little thicker than is required to be reduced by the cutter, 'as will hereinafter be described. Descm'ption of the peem'ng r0ZZer.-That part of the roller marked a, on the drawing is called the peen, and in form resembles a spoon bowl, it is left highest at the point a, which is designed to form the center of the spoon bowl. From the point a, this peen slopes in every direction in a manner corresponding to the desired thickness of the silver in the bowl of a spoon, that is it is so' shaped that in rolling the silver through, the part of the bar, in contact with this peen, is pressed most at the center a, and least at the point, when thebowl of the spoon is required to be thickest. This peen, or spoon bowl is formed by grinding, or filing the rollers as follows. The roller is cut away at the heel of the bowl where the shoulder of the handle is to be formed, just equal to the much is cut away from the roller that they bar of silver is not pressed at all in passing in part of it. From the point a, to c, there is a gradual slope, so that when the rollers are brought to their nearest contact with each other, and the spoon rolled through there is a gradual diminuation in the thickness of the silver from a, to 6. At 6, the roller is left plain, nothing being cut away at f, or at the end of the handle, the roller is a little sunk again to leave increased thickness at the end of the handle, or in' a word at all these points above referred to the roller is cut away sufiicient to press the silver in the proportions required. A bar of silver passes through the part of the mill prepared as above described from six to twelve times. The screws being put down at every turn comes out at last with a bowl nearly in perfect shape, and with the silver laid precisely where it is wanted. The handle has its just proportion as to thickness, but is not now in its proper form; to obtain this, and at the same time increase its length, and give elasticity, and preserve and perfect its proportion, it must now be rolled through the cutter C, D, entering at the point of the bowl. The cutter is the exact form, and proportion of a spoon in all its parts, at every point it has the width, and depth of the spoon required, so that while it cuts the spoon to its proper shape, it at the same time gives to it its true proportion of thickness, and leaves the handle hard, and elastic, while the bowl, which is not to be pressed much if at all is left soft, and ready to be raised. The cutting edges of thiscutter are formed as will be seen by the drawing by removing the steel all around the cutter. A sufficient portion'of the roller, must be removed to receive the chips, or pieces of silver to be cut off while at each side of this excavation around the cutter 7"", the roller is left perfect so that both rolls shall come in contact with each other. on each side of the cutter in order to prevent the cutting edges from being injured. Both the drawing and the model presents the cutter, and the peening, or plating process 'upon one, and the same pair of rollers, but in practice it is preferable that two different and separate mills be employed. One roller may be prepared and fitted for several different sized spoons. Teas and tables, salts and creams, may be all put upon one roller if its size and length be suflicient, in this case one mill will plate a variety of spoons, while another mill may be used for cutting, this may have a short pair of rollers, and have but one spoon upon each, or. a longer roller, and several different sizes upon one and the same roller, but the short roller with but one cutter upon it will be preferable. With these mills in connection with a plain and common plater mill the whole labor of giving form to silver spoons is contemplated. The silver will pass directly from the ingot to the common rolling mill and be rolled to the size required for the peening or plating mill described above, from that it goes to the cutting mill, and is there turned out in perfect form. These mills may each and severally be turned by hand, water, or steampower. By steam or water power a spoon a minute may be produced 1n a form suitable for ra1s1ng and finlshing. The drawlng E, F, represents a cutter designed to pass through two plain rollers. This cutter is in all respects like the one out into the roll with this exception, it is designed to pass between two rolls instead of being out into a roller, but the cutter on the roller will be found best in practioe though more expensive. Now what I claim as new in principle, and practice, and as my invention is- 1. The shaping of a roller of a common platers mill, so that it shall receive a bar of silver widthwise, and roll it into the shape of a spoon, one end for the bowl, and the other for the handle, leaving the bowl in its proper shape with thesilver thickest at the edges and thinnest in the middle, and this to be made separate from though designed for a cutter. 2. The formation of a cutter in the same, 'or a separate mill, or on a separate piece of steel designed only to cut off the edges, without altering at all the thickness of the silver in the bowl, but to extend the length of the handle, perfect its proportionate thickness, and cut it to its proper shape. It is then made separately, but combined in their use, as above described, and not anything designed to perform both operations at once, for which I ask Letters Patent. I witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name this seventh day of Sep tember, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six.

To all whom it may concern: Be it known that I, HARMAN HIBBARD, of Darien, in the county of Genesee and State of New York, have invented a new and useful Improvement in the Art of Manufacturing Paints; and I do hereby declare that the followingis a full and exact description. The nature of my invention consists in using-1st flowers of sulfur, sulfuric acid, and carbonate of lead in forming Prussianblue. 2d in using nitric acid, and carbonate of lead to form chrome yellow. 3d in the further use of flowers of sulfur to form chrome green, 4th in the formation of a metallic green from sulfate of copper, and carbonate of lead. To enable others skilled in the art to make and use my invention, I will proceed to describe the process by which these paints may be prepared. To make Prussian blue, dissolve 16 lbs. sulfate of iron in as small a quantity of boiling water as possible, dissolve 1 lb. of prussiate of potash in 1 pint of boiling water after being finely pulverized, and add to the sulfate of iron add 1 lb. of carbonate of lead and 1} lb. of flowers of sulfur previouly ground together in water, then add sulfuric acid till effervescence ceases, the sediment should be left with an excess, of acid possessing a sour taste, the whole should be tho-roughly blended together, and then left to dry. To make chrome yellow, to 16 lbs. carbonate of lead finely ground in water, and put into a tub containing 16 gallons of boiling water add 1 lb. chromate of potash (previously dissolved in 3 gallons of boiling water) to the solution of potash add 8,-oz. nitric acid, and add this mixture to the tub containingthe carbonate of lead, taking care to keep up agitation for some minutes then leave, and the lead will fall, decant the water, and dry the sediment. To make chrome-green, to 1, lb. Prussian blue add 2, lbs. of chrome yellow, and 1 lb. flowers of. sulfur, the-whole should bemoistened with water and finely pulverized together, a suflicient quantity of sulfuric acid should be added to leave a sour taste if the effervescenceceases, the sediment should then be dried without washing. To form a metallic green, dissolve 1, lb. sulfate of copper in 3 gallons of boiling water, and add 1, lb. carbonate of lead, previously pulverized in 1, pint of hot-water, then put into 3 gallons of boiling water, pour the solution lead intothe solution of copper slowly, and at the same time keep up a constant agitation, it may then be left to subside, pour off the water, and dry the sediment. hat I claim as my invention, and desire rating the composition with oxygen which forms the blue,I use the carbonate of lead to precipitate the iron, to discharge the'superfluous acid, and to assist in forming a body to the paint. 2. In the use of nitric acid, and carbonate of lead in preparing chrome yellow, the acid discharges the carbon contained in the lead and causes the chromate, and lead to unite. 3. In the further use of the flowers of sulfur in preparing chrome green, the sulfur prevents the green fro-m discharging the blue when exposed to the atmosphere. the formation of a metallic green-from sulfate of copper, and carbonate of lead.

To all who 11bit may concern: Be it known that I, ISAIAHJENNINGS, of the city of New York, in the State of New York, have inventedra new and useful improvement in the production of fire and light by a combination of liquids and the application of the same in common lamps either with or without a wick; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. The liquids that I usually employ are, alcohol and spirits of turpentine which two liquids I combine together in such a way that the alcohol will be saturated with the spirits of turpentine soas to carbonate the same and cause it to burn with brilliancy. The quantity of turpentine that will combine with the alcohol will depend upon the strength of the latter fluid, which to afford a clear white light should be such as will enable it to form a combination containing not less than one-sixth part of turpentine, but if it will combine so that turpentine will form one-fifth, it is to be preferred. Although I generally use spirits of turpentine, I have essayed other essential oils and analogous compounds which I have found to answer thesame purpose more or less per- I fectly, but I have preferred spirits of turpentine on account of the economy with which it can be used. When the' strength of the alcohol is known, the exact quantity that will combine may be at once added, but it may be put in, in excess agitated and the uncombined portion allowed to separate, and the liquid decanted. I am aware that I am not the discoverer of the simple fact that the addition of spirits of turpentine or other essential oils to alcohol will cause it to burn with increased brilliancy, but I claim to be the discoverer of the applicability of this combined material and of others possessing analogous properties as a substitute for oil in common lamps; and the first who has applied the same, having been enabled so to do by my experiments upon the proper combining proportions according to the strength of the alcohol, and it is for this discovery and application that I solicit Letters Patent.

32,,,"Description J. J. Low'Nnsf PENCIL AND PEN CASE. Patented Sept. 22, 1836. Ill UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE. JACOB I. LOWNDS, OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. PENCIL AND PEN CASE. Specification of Letters Patent N0. 32, dated September 22, 1836. To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, JACOB I. LowND-s, of the city of Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and Improved Ever-Pointed Pencil and Pen Case, and that the following is a full and exact description thereof, reference being had to the drawing which accompanies and makes part of this specification. The exterior tube of the case is open at its two ends only not having any longitudinal slit to admit a slide for protruding the point, this being effected in a different manner, to be presently described. The exterior tube represented at Figure 1 has a plain surface, but it may be ornamented in any manner which may be preferred. Figs. 2 and 3 show the interior tubes which fit into Fig. 1, within which Fig. 2 is made to slide, the upper of Fig. 2, contains the pen slide and holder, and also the reservoir for spare pencil points; the latter consists of a tube connected with. a, and its alan is represented by the dotted lines it readhes down to b, where it is soldered to a diaphragm or partition reaching across that part of the tube, and extends up to the upper end of a, and is there inclosed by a small screw cap, its length is sufficient to enable it to contain two lengths of pencil points, 0, the penholder is situated in the space, between the two tubes, and this is slid out by means of the small screw button 6, in the slot d. The tube a, being reduced or flattened to allow the head or button 6, sufficient space with out obstructing its passage into the interior tube where the pen is, there is sufficient space between the reservoir, and the tube a, to carry two extra steel pens with perfect convenience. F ig. 4, is the screw cap or head of the pencil case, it has a tube 6, with a screw cut on the outside of it, the female screw into which it works being cut in the inside of the upper end of a. The exterior of which tube passes within the cup while the tube 0, admits the point of the pen. By this arrangement the whole length nearly of the cap, is saved in the length of the pencil case. a The lower end of f, of the interior tube Fig. 2, is that which receives the pencil point and appurtenances to be now described Fig. 5, which contain the lead is at its lower part 6, made in all respects like those in general use, its upper or cylindrical portion h, is to occupy the part, 7, of the tube Fig. 2. i is a projecting cheek piece, or feather, which when Fig. 5, is in its place occupies the slit j, and also the slit k, in Fig. 3, this latter tube fitting on to f, Fig. 2. The two slots y', and is, being made to coincide, and the feather 2', rising high enough to pass through both of them wherethe respective points 2, 3, and 5, are put together the whole is to be passed into the exterior tube Fig. 1, the lower end Z of Fig. 3 is then attached to the lower end m, of Fig. 1, by soft soldering them together, and on screwing the Head Fig. 4:, into its place, the instrument is complete. Operation of the instrument: When the pencil point is within the case, the feat-her 2', occupies the upper ends of the slots j, and is, and to cause thepoint to protrude, the tube Fig. 2, is drawn u by means of the head Fig. 4. This tube sliding in the ex terior tube, and also in Fig. 3, the drawing up of the interior tube brings the lower part of the slot j, into contact with the feather t, which consequently checks it, on pushing the head down, the pencil point is protruded, and ready for use, and when no longer wanted it may be readily pushed back by the finger. To cause the cylindrical part it, of Fig. 5, to slide freely, and evenly within its tube f, it is surrounded at n, by a divided opening ferrule which is in part received within a groove, turned in 71/, for that purpose; when the pen is to be used the'tube is to be drawn out, the head unscrewed, and the pen protruded by means of the button as before described, the head may be screwed into the opposite end a female screw being cut withinl, for that purpose. Having thus fully described the everpointed pencil, and pen case invent-ed by me, and thereby shown that it differs essentially in the general arrangement and combination of its parts throughout with the single exception of that portion thereof whichcontains and protrudes the lead point, I do hereby claim This particular arrangement and construction which I esteem as sufficiently characteristic to distinguish it from all others before used, or known. I do not however by this claim to limit myself to the manner of constructing this instrument in all its-minuteness, as herein pointed out but to vary it as I may think proper while it remains essentially the same in combination and operation.

Specification of Letters Patent No. 33, dated September 29, 1836.r To all whom t may concern Be it known that I, JOHN HARRIMAN, of Haverhill, in the county of Essex and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have invented new and useful Improvements in the Manner of Constructing a Franklin Stove for Cooking and other Purposes, and that the following is a full and exact description of the construction and operation of the said stove as improved by me. l This stove is to be made of cast iron, eX- oept the oven, which is to be made of sheetiron. It consists of the following principal parts viz: 1st, the bottom plate; 2d, the top; 3d, the two insides; 4th, the front; 5th, the end plate; 6th, the back of the fire place; 7th, the grate; 8th, the cover of the grate; 9th, the plate over the lire near the top plate; 10th, the oven; 11th, the plate over the oven; 12th, the dampers; 13th, the doors; 14th, the openings for the boilers, &c. The bottom plate forms the shape of the stove. The lire place is like that of a Franklin parlor stove. In the fire place are a grate and cover, the cover is hung on axes lat each end which pass through side ofl the stove, the cover turns up against the back of the stove, when down it rests on the edge of the grate, and incloses t-he lire to increase the draft, and for other purposes. The fire is visible at all times through the front of the grate when kindled. On the top, on the top-plate are two openings for boilers, (and there may be more if desired) also an opening for a funnel, behind the lire place, and under the boilers is the oven which has a door at each end, and on the side near the front is another door opening into the fire place for the purpose of putting in fuel. In this stove there are five flues, and four dampers, one flue which I call the gra-te flue consisting of several openings near the bottom of the back of the tire place. It admits of the fire, Sac., from the tire place to the oven, and up by the back thereof. There is a space between theoven, and the bottom, and end plates sulcient for the fire to pass up to the plate over the oven, thence crossing about half the width of the oven to the two semicircular openings in the plate over the oven, and thence to the funnel on the top of the stove. This plate has also other openings for flues. The first mentioned grate flue has a damper which I call the grate damper, which is fit-ted to the flue, and is moved by a rod, which passes through the side of the stove. This damper is to regulate the heat under the oven. There are two ues in the front part of the plate over the oven which are over the main tire, they form a partV of the fire place, and have each a damper which is moved separately by rods projecting from the back of the stove. The object of these is to take the lire from the lire place and carry it up under the two boilers, (which may be of any required size) over the oven, and through the top plate, the lire and smoke escaping by this course to the funnel on t-he top of the stove. There are also two other flues in the fire place', over the fire, and near the top plate which will receive all the fire and smoke from the fire place and from around the boilers if desired, and conduct it to the funnel on the top of the stove. The two last mentioned flues have one damper which is bent so as to form two sides at right angles to each other, and so fixed as to open or close both these flues at the same tim-e. The plate over the oven contains two semicircular openings, and two flues, said plate has a partit-ion from its under side to the oven. The above openings are on one side of the partition, and the flues are on the other side, the partition separating the ues from` the openings. These semic-ircular openings serve as outlets to bring the heat over the oven, and under the boilers. It will be seen that the fire can escape from the fireplace in three ways, and all centering to the boilers. That I claim as my invention, and wish to secure by Let-ters Patent is The plate containing the semioircular openings, and two flues, and the uses to which I have applied it, also the cover of the grate, and the damper at thebaok of the grate, and the way in which I have applied them.

To all whom, it may concern: Be it known that we, JOSEPH IV. STRANGE and ELIAS STRANGE, of Taunton, in the county of Bristol and State of Massachusetts, have invented au Improvement in Vertical Cylindrical Steam-Boilers; and we do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof, reference being had to the drawings which accompany and make a part of this specification. lIn this boiler the furnace and ash-pit are situated in themmanner common to vertical cylindrical boilers, and as we generally construct it we employ three concentric cylinders, the middle one of which constitutes the main tlue immediately above the furnace, and between which and the second cylinder the main body of the water to be heated is contained. The space between the second and outer cylinder forms an exterior flue surrounding the boiler, and within it also are contained tubes leading from the upper to the lower part of the boiler for the circulation of water in a wayto be presently described. Figure 1 in the accompanying drawings represents a vertical section of the boiler, A being the ash-pitand B the furnace. C is the vert-ical flue closed at the upper end by a cap or cover c, the communication from the center line C to that which surrounds 4the boiler being through a series of tubes and runninghorizontally, or nearly so, to the space between the second and exterior cylinders. These tubes are marked D D D, and the outer space into which they open is marked E E. They of course operate as so many flues, the heated air from the furnace passing through them, and iu doing so communicating its heat to the water by which they are surrounded. Fig. 2 is a horizontal section of the boiler through one of the tiers of horizontal tubes, of which ten are represented in Fig. l. The same letters are used in both figures to designate similar parts. F FF, Figs. l and 2, is the water-space between the tubes. The dotted line G, Fig. 1, is the water-line and H the steam-chamber. The number of tubes passing horizontally may be varied; but, as shown in the drawings, they would amount to eighty, there being eight in each of the ten tiers. To cause a circulation of water in the boiler, we place a number of tubes passing vertically through the space E and opening into the water at the upper and lower ends of the boiler. Two of these tubes are seen at I I. The number of these may vary; but we think that eight will be sufficient. The outer wall or crust of the space E E may, if preferred, be built of brick or other material; or if made of sheetiron it may be surrounded by brick-work or other bad conductor of heat. Instead of placing thetubes I I in the way described, we intend sometimes to surround what in Fig'. l is the outer cylinder by a fourth, forming a space J J, Fig. 3, communicating above and below with the water in the boiler and allowing of a free circulation thereof. This space is also represented at J J, Fig. v2. The variation in the arrangement of the parts which will be rendered necessary by the substitution of this cylindrical water-space for the tubes will be apparent to every competent engineer. /Ve have not given any particular dimensions or scale of proportions, as these may be changed without altering theprinciple of construction and may be safely left to the judgment of those conversant with such structures. We do not claim to be the inventors of the individual parts of the within described boiler, concentric cylinders, and horizontal and vertical tubes, both of the passage of `heated air and the conveyance of water be- .ing well known and having been frequently employed in boilers; but What we do claim as our invention is The manner in which we have arranged and combined these cylinders and tubes, as herein set forth, constructing, as we believe, a boiler which is essentially new in its general character. - JOSEPH /V./S' [`RANGE.

Plate number one is a side elevation of a wagon, with a View of the brake; plate numbered two is an end elevation of the same with part of the brake drawn separately, and at large; plate numbered three is a top view of the same; the figures excepting parts of the brake at large are drawn on a scale of three-fourths of an inch to the foot, and the parts aforesaid are drawn on a scale of an inch to a foot. 7"", indicates what I denominate the brake wheel, which is a circular rim like that of a wheel made of wood, and hooped with iron with a flange on each side rising about an inch and a half above the rim so as to form a groove for the brake. This brake wheel should be in the proportion of about two feet diameter and about three inches in thickness, and two inches in breadth for a wagon wheel of five feet in diameter. The brake wheel is fastened to the spokes of the hindmost wheel of the wagon, stage coach or other carriage, on the inside of the wheel, by clasps of iron passing around the spokes and through the rim of the brake wheel, and confined by nuts on the opposite sides. 6, indicates the brake of wood about two inches wide and about three inches thick capped on the outside with a strong piece of iron like the tire of a wheel fastened to it by screws, be to the periphery of the brake wheel. The brake turned at the hindmost end turns upon a hinge fixed to a piece of wood, at tached to. the wagon, carriage, or vehicle,- and acts as a lever where the hinge serves as the fulcrum. At the opposite end the brake is connected with a lever indicated (Z, made of wrought iron of the shape represented in the drawing in plate numbered one, and fiXed to a cross piece, whiohpasses under the carriage, and is fixed to a like lever of a like brake to a like brake wheel, on the'other side when two brakes are used, which is deemed best in all cases.

The seat of the lire room is cast in a separate piece from the other part of the bottom-plate and is placed into and rests upon lanches upon the sides and ends of the main portion of the bottom plate, and is sunk, two inches below the surface of the hearth, directly over this part of the bottom pla'te, the oven and the flues passing under, and at the back side of the oven, are placed. The bottom plate rests upon four legs, on the edges of the rectangular part of the bottom plate, and upon the hearth are cast ianches for fixing the side plates of the stove in their proper positions. The sides are about twelve inches high and covered by a top plate corresponding nearly in its form to the bottom plate except that part of the bottom plate which is necessary for a hearth in front of the body of the stove. In the top plate over the fire-room and in front of and between the cranes is a boiler hole about eight inches in diameter and the back part of the top plate is a hole and collar for the stove pipe. The oven is constructed by passing plates from side to side of the stove leaving spaces of about one and one half inches between it and the bottom, top and back plates. These spacesare the flues for conveying the flame and heat or smo-ke around the oven and to the pipe. In front of the oven and between it and the re room, is a chamber formed on the back side by an oven plate, and in front and on the top by a thick plate the Ibottom of this chamber being formed by an extension of the -bottom plate of the oven and by means of this chamber the temperature of the oven is equalized. Between the chamber and fire room is a thick plate distant about two inchesfrom the chamber and reaching within aboutfive or six inches of the stop plate. The fire room occupies the front part and about one third of the body of the stove. The heat is regulated by a damper in the front part of the ire-room'which slides up, and down in grooves directly over the fire room are two boiler places which I call cranes. These cranes revolve by axes being placed in the rear corners of the fire room on the sides of the stove, with their pivotsr inserted in the bottom and top plates. They are from three to four inches 'deep and parallel when swung in, with the sides of the stove without bottoms and with collars for resting places for kettles. These cranes are cast'in parts separate from the top plate. When swung forward, the projecting top plates or wings assume the places of the boiler holes and prevent the passage of the lire and smoke into the room by swinging the boilers off, they are deprived of the greatest portion of the heat of the tire and the quantity of the heat necessary for cooking is regulated thereby, as a current of cold air is then permitted to pass underneath the boiler so as to drive the heat from the same.

This improvement in crimping is an improvement of my machine for crimping boots, for Vwhich I'obtained a patent bearing date the twenty-seventh day of July, A.. D. 1824, the specification, or schedule whereof is in the words following, viz: This machine is calculated to improve, and facilitate the crimping of boots. It is composed of a shin or board, for giving the front 0f the boo-t its proper shape together with any number of straining clamps made of iron, or any suitable material, and also any number of holding clamps made similar to the cabinet makers veneering clamps, these are to hold the front of the boot to its place till dry. You may use the straining clamps for other boards or shins while the others are drying. The power is given to the straining clamps by a thumb screw to each clamp. My peculiar improvement consists in having, and using the above clamps instead of pincers, and tacks for drawing the leather on the board or shin, and after being down to its proper place to be secured by the above described holding clamps. The distinctive character of my present improvement consists in using a horizontal plate having its ends turned up at right angles, forming ears with two round apertures in each, in a line with each other, through which round pins tapered like a wedge are inserted to hold securely the ends of the leather to be strained, there being two parallel grooves in said plate into which the pins force the leather, and thus increase their hold on the same, and from the other side projects a tube 1n which a female screw is cut, said tube being inserted into an aperture made in the heel of the shin, and which 1s caused to advance into o-r recede from said aperture byV means of a thumb screw similarly constructed to the one described in my former patent, said screw turning in the female screw in the tube just described, and bearing on a step at the bottom of the aperture in the shin by which the motion just mentioned is given to the plate, or as shall hereafter term it the horizontal clamp. The shin excepting the aperture in the heel is similarly constructed to those in use. The leather is put over the shin in the usual method; but its ends are secured, in the horizontal clamp in the manner, before described, and strained by turning the thumb screw which draws the leather over the shin, simultaneously 0n each side.

In the common method of generating steam, the lime, earthy substances, &c., contained in the water, are deposited, and adhere around the inner surface of the boiler, thus not only requiring it to be frequently emptied, and cleaned but the accumulation of the lime, earth, or sediment within the boiler prevents the water from doinO its oflice of protecting it by conveying off the heat into the water, but by this accumulation .of sediment the boiler is rendered liable to be burnt out in a short time. The improvement which I have made is 'designed to obviate these evils, and consists of the following apparatus: In addition to the boiler, and engine heater for the cold water I construct another vessel, A, in which the water is first boiled, and purified before it enters the boiler. This vessel is rst constructed of a size, shape, and strength adapted to the boiler, inside this vessel A, is a partition B, dividing it longitudinally into two chambers, C, D, at one end of one of the chambers, C, is placed the heater E, communicating with the main boiler by a pipe F, in which there is a stop-cock Gr, and in the toA K, punched with holes to prevent the hay, &c. passing with the water to the pipe L, conducting to the force-pump. In one end of the heater is a cock M, to let ofi3 the condensed steam, the water from the engine heater passes to the vessel or cistern A, by a pipe N, where it is boiled'by the heater communicating with the boiler, the steam passing from the boiler through the pipe F, to the heater E, the lime or other substance with which the water is impregnated adhering to the hay, &c. the water thus purified passes to the force-pump, from whence it is pumped into the boiler in the usual way, the strainers serving to arrest the passage of hay, &c. to the pipe of the force-pump. The invention here claimed as new, and original and for which a patent is solicited, consists in- The method of purifying water before it enters the boiler, by means of the before described apparatus. l MOODY PARK.

Q ORESTES BADGER, OF OTSEGO, AND ORRIN SULL, OF YVATERLOQ NEW YORK. DOUBLE HYDROSTATIC OIL-PRESS. Specification forming part of Letters Patent To all whom it may concern: Be it known that I, OREsTEs BADGER, of the town of Otsego, in the county of Otsego and the State of New York, and I, ORRIN SULL, of the town of WVaterloo, in the county of Seneca, in the State of New York, did on the ninth day of August, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, obtain Letters Patent of the United States for an Improvement in Hydrostatic Presses, which we denominated the Double Hydrostatic Oil-Press and we do hereby declare that the following is a' full and exact description of the said hydrostatic press, ' which description is to be taken in lieu of that upon which the above-named Letters Patent were originally granted, the said Letters Patent being hereby surrendered on accountof defects which have been discovered in the specification, and the following conforming, as we verily believe, with requirements of the laws in that case made and provided. The double hydrostatic oil press as constructed by us operates upon the seed, or other substance to be pressed, by means of two pistons which are forced out of the opposite ends of a cylinder placed horizontally, which two pistons are subjected simultaneously to the power produced by the ordinary hydrostatic press, or any forcing pump operating upon the same principle. The different parts of this press may be varied in size as may be preferred, and the measurements herein given may be considered therefore as only intended to facilitate description, and as presenting the machine in what may be considered its ordinary size. The frame which is to contain the pressing cylinder, the pistons, and the article to be pressed may be made in part of wood, or altogether of iron, care being had so to construct it that it shall have sufficient strength to sustain the great pressure to which it is subjected. It consists mainly of two side pieces, or cheeks, and of two end pieces, or cheeks, and of two end pieces, or heads, the thickness of these will depend upon the ma terials employed in making them, the end No. 40, dated August 9', 1832; Reissued October 5, to be placed in the middle between the 7 heads, and sides of the machine frame where it is to be secured by proper plates, and bolts. It may be made of cast iron from three to five feet in length, its chamber extends from end to end, and may be from ten to twelve inches in diameter, its thickness from two, and a half to five inches, and hooped with heavy bars of wrought iron. Into each end of this cylinder is fitted a piston made solid, and fitting the bore, which are to be packed, or leathered in the way usual in hydrostatic presses. These pistons extend out from each end of the cylinder having heads on them, and between which heads, and the end pieces of the frame, the pressure is to be made. The pistons of course must be of such length as to adapt them to the length of the frame, leaving just enough room for the article pressed. The hydrostatic pressure is made, by forcing water into the pressing cylinder through an opening in the middle of the cylinder between the two pistons forcing them out horizontally in the direction of the ends of the frame. The common forcing pump used for hydrostatic presses together with the safety valve, and usual appendages of hydrostatic presses being employed will produce the necessary pressure in the aforesaid cylinder. The tubs to contain the seed, or other article be pressed, are made, and managed, in the usual manner being placed edgewise resting on barsto sustain them in the proper position between the ends of the pistons, and the heads of the frame. All that is claimed as constituting the in- Vention or improvement, for which a patent time, and the charging with water, and also is claimed isthe discharging has to be less frequently The employment of two pistons operated performed. upon in the manner, and for the purposes ORESTE'S BADGER. 5 herein set forth for pressing oil from seeds, ORRIN SULL. and for pressing other articles to which Witnesses to O.

41,,,"Description FREDERICK J. AUSTIN, OF NEW YORK, N. Y. HAND :PRINTING-PRESS. Specification of Letters Patent No. 41, 4dated October 8, 1836. To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, FREDERICK J. AUSTIN, of the city of New York, machinist, have invented a new and useful improvement. in hand printing-presses by which the friction in taking an impression is lessened. and the power applied in a manner more direct and eficient than heretofore; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full and' eX- act description thereof, reference being had to the drawings, which accompany and make a part of this specification. t The castings or other frame of this press may be made, and put together of the usual modes of the bed, the round, the platen, and other parts may also be constructed in any of the known ways that are suitable to such process, my invention relating solely to the arrangement of the apparatus by which the power of the lever is communicated to the toggle joints or knees by which the platen is moved up and down. Figure 1, in the drawings is a side view of the press, and Fig. 2, a front view thereof. In these figures however, but little of the peculiarity of its construction'is shown, this being principally represented in Figs. E3, and l, which gives a view of the upper side of the platen, and the curvilinear piece with the toggle joints, or knees to be presently described. In all of these figures the parts which correspond are designated by the same letters of reference. A, Fig. 3, is an iron plate which extends across from one side or check of the press to the other where it is firmly attached. B, is an opening through this plate within which the knees or toggle joints work. C, is a horizontal segment of the upper segment of the joint. D, is a piece which forms a part o f the lower segment of the knee of toggle joint, being a continuation thereof upward from one side thereof so as to rise above the Vrule joint by which they are connected, and to receive the action of the piece E, which is jointed to the lever or arbor of the press in such a situation, and as compels it to advance by the pull in a direct or straight line, or very nearly so during its whole action, the mannervin which this rises from the'lower knee is shown more directly in Fig. 6, it being a detached drawing of the lower knee. `The lever is so formed as Lto admit the .joint pins G, H, to p-ass through it at a distance of three or four inches apart a line connecting their centers forming a right angle, or nearly so with the line of the lever. The straps I, connected to the lever by thepin II, works at its other end, on a pin J, passing also through K, a piece firmly attached t0 thejplate A, and to thev side of the press. A second strap corresponding with J, seen at J1, Fig. 2, is placed under the lever, the same joint pin passing through both. A part of the plate A, is to serve as a fulcrum or bearing against which the lever works in such a way that its points of bearingis continually changing. Thus L, is made a curvilinear, and has within it cogs or teeth, one of which is seen at M, and into these teeth there gears a segment pinion N, securely fastened upon the'lower side of the lever, thus forming the progressive fulcrum above mentioned. The position of the lever is shown in the drawing, Fig. 3, is that in which it stands when the platen is raised to its greatest height, and when forced completely down, J, I-I, and G, will be in a straight line, or nearly so, and by the arrangement herein shown the piece E, which acts against the toggle joint will during the whole progress of the pull move in a straight line, or nearly so, and will consequently convey the power of the lever in the act of taking an impression with less loss, than is encountered in processes made upon any of the plans heretofore known. These parts are more distinctly shown iny Fig. 4, which is a detached drawing of the plate A, and the segment pinion N. L, is a portion of the part formed curvilinear, and embraces the principle of the epicycloid in which a small circle is made to roll along the inside of a large one. The dotted lines represent one of the straps I, which retain the segment N, in its place, and by turning on the joint pins I, H, compels the teeth always to come in contact. The lever is firmly secured on the upper side of the pinion N, as shown in Fig. 3, and by moving back, and forward will cause the different teeth to engage, and thus form and through them it is communicated to the vertical toggle joints or knees, and thereby much increasing the power of the press. What I claim as my invention, and wish to secure by Letters Patent iso The particular arrangement of the part conveyin the power of the lever, to the toggle joint or knees, in which a pinion is geared into teeth so as to form a rogressive fulcrum for the purpose, and su st-antially in the manner herein set forth, notl including however by this description, and claim to limit myself in the construction and arrangement of the parts precisely to the form and manner given, but to vary the same as I may think proper while the same end is attained by analogous means.

To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, ALoNzo PLATT, of Middletown, in the county of MiddleseX and State of Connecticut, have invented a new and useful Hanging Lamp, which I call the Union Lamp, and I do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. In my invention a clear and vivid light is produced by the union of three (or more or less) separate and distinct lamps or reservoirs, so combined as to burn under one glass, these lamps may be made of different shapes to suit the fancy, but that of a fish is recommended as the best. To construct the lamp let the several fishes be so arranged heads to heads, as to make equal divisions of a circle described upon their opposite ends. The heads should not be in close. contact, but a little distance apart. Let the fishes be connected together by small braces or by a ring near their heads, the fishes or lamps may be of block tin or any other suitable metal cast whole in molds, or cast in two or more parts, and afterward soldered together. They may be painted or otherwise ornamented at pleasure. Let there be flat tubes for the wicks, about one inch in width, and two or more inches in length, made of tin or other proper metal let in at the heads of the fishes standing obliquely from a perpendicular position, the upper ends being nearest the center. The wick tubes are made to open and shut in the manner-of a hinge for the purpose of removing and replacing the wicks with facility. The orifices in which the tubes are inserted are encircled by small collars s0 dis posed as to cat-ch the drippings from the wicks. Let the feeder of each lamp be inserted on any convenient partof it, place a common globular glass tube over the wicks 1n the usual way, suspend the lamp by means appear that there is an open space between the several lamps through which the light from the burning wicks is communicated in direct rays without the obstruction of any surrounding shell or body, making not only a more perfect light in all directions than any other hanging light produces, but an entirely perfect light under the lamp casting no circle, shadow or shade. When necessary a plane glass may be placed upon the connecting braces or ring or in some other manner under the flame, so as to catch sparks falling from the wicks, which will render it a safe and efficient lamp for cotton factories, and in other dangerous situations.

To all 'whom t may concern: Be it known that we, ENos ALvoRD and NELSON ALvoRD, of West-field, in the county of Hampden and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and improved machine j or lathe adapted to the turning of a great variety of articles, both large'and small,` according to the purpose to which it is toy be applied, and its frame work `may be differently constructed while the principle upon which it n operates will remain unchanged, but forV the purpose ofdescription, we have taken, and given the dimensions of the parts of a medium size, which we have constructed, and used, and which we have found to answer well in practice. In the drawing, a, a, b, b, (Z, CZ, and e, e, represent the frame work of the machine, a, a are two sills live feet and a half long three inches high, and two inches thick. b, I), are three cross sills, one foot long from inside to inside, iiveand a half inches high, and two inches thick, they consequently rise two and a half inches above the side sills, and this is done for'the purpose vof passing a bolt through them and through the posts d, d. These four posts areve inches long from shoulder to shoulder, and are two inches square. The plates e, e, constituting the top of the frame, are two inches thick, and three wide. The mandrel c is fixed in the ordinary way of fixing mandrels in colleer and mandrel lathes, and so that its axis shall correspond with a center line between the sills and the plates. The two head sills b, I), are fourteen inches apart which allows a good length for the man.- drel. Screw rods or bolts f, f, f, extend from the side sills to the plates on each side of the frame, as shown in the drawing. The ends of these bolts are formed into pivots which pass into, and revolve in bushed holes in the sills, and plates, five such bolts on each side we deem sufficient for a machine of the size described. These bolts may be l iive-eighths of an inch in diameter, in the middle they are made :square for about half an inch in length for the purpose of turn ing them by means of a wrench., they are tapped at one end with a right handed, and at the other with a left handed screw, the threads of which must be equal, and extend from the pivots to the square. Elastic strips lof steel or other metal g, g, two inches wilde, and one-fourth of an inch thick are drilled :and tapped so as to correspond with-@fthe screws on the bolts which pass-through them, and by being turned determine the dist-ance of these strips from each other for the pur pose to be presently ,described` The piece marked la, and shown separately in Figure 2, we denomina-te the jack, it is made of timber three inches square, and its length is such as to till the space between the lopposite strips g, g, b y which it is to be guided in its Vpassage along thev machine. It has on each end a plate of metal, z', which may be a circular disk of cast-iron, half any inch thick, andthree inches in diameter, on each of these plates there are four project` ing pins, le, 7c, 7:, 7c, placed in pairs at the opposite edges, the two forming a pair being one-fourth of an inch `apart, so as to -embrace the strips g., g, betweenvthem, the jack thus constructed vwhen placed between these places, and embracing them by its pins may Y be made to slide along them, and will adapt it to such sinuosit-y, or curvature as may be given to them Upon the under side of ,the jack .a cutter b, is fixed which cutter is curved, and answers the purpose both of a gouge, and chisel in the operationof turning, it lies along the face of the jack to which it is affixed by a screw, in its nvowtch,V the cutting edges being immediately""iinder the throat n, through which the turnings are delivered. M, M, M, are setscrewswhich bear against and regulate the cutter. There is a second piece of timber similar in size to the jack, and armed at each end in like manner with plates, and pins tting on the lower steel plates, and forming a counter to the jack, as the piece to be turned is embraced between them. An excavation 1 is made on the upper face of the cut to receive the article to be turned. It is in form like the haltl of a trumpet mouth, admitting at its longer part the unturned article, and by its smaller, coniining it when turned. The piece marked O, on the jack is an iron rest, or cheek piece, which is made to bear Cil the guides g, g. The cross excavation on ,thel cat, before spoken of, is faced with, or consists of iron, and upon the face of the jack opposite to the edge of the cutter there is a projecting piece of iron, similar in form to one half of the excavation in the cat, and corresponding with it. The part called w, yw, is called' the slide, and is shown separately in Fig. 4. lts upper part consists of a frame about one foot square which is furnished with tongues that lit into grooves on the inner edges of the plates e, e, as shown in the drawing. S, S, S, S, are parallel iron rods half an inch in diameter and three inches apart, so placed as to embrace the plates, or disks z', z', on either end of the jack, and cat between them; 25, t, are braces to steady them. Between these rods the jack and cat can traverse up, and down, and vibrate to the extent required as they pass along the steel guides. TheI part u, as shown separately in Fig. 5, we call the catch, as its office is to hold, and` steady the part of the article which has been turned; it runs in grooves in the sills, its standard, or upright, Q1, having a hole in it sufficiently large for the intended purpose. It is brought up by the weight X, and its structure and use are too obvious to require further description. VOpera-tion: When the article to be turned is intended to be cylindrical or of the same diameter from end to end thescrew-bolts f, f, are so turned that the guide strips g, g, shall be parallel to each other, and at such distance apart as shall correspond with the intended size of the article, one end of which is then xed in a suitable chuck, and the slide fw, w, Figa, carrying the jack, and cat, the pins, on the ends of which embrace the guide strips, is made to advance by hand so as to receive the piece to be turned between the notc hin the cat, and the cutter, and by continuing to advance the slide the turning is effected. When the jack has arrived close against the chuck it may be lifted out, and the turned piece removed, the upper guide strips having notches made in them to allow the Vlower pins which embrace the strip to pass through. When the piece to be turned is to be taper or of variable diameter the guide strips must be so set as to produce the desired form, as the ends of the guide strips must draw in when they dovnot stand parallel to each other it will be found best, in order to prevent bending, or crampingin setting to allow the screw bolts f, f, one of them excepted to workin bushes that are in some degree ovaling lengthwise of the frame, without giving lateral play. Instead of constructing the machine with a mandrelV as described this part may be omitted, and the frame with its appendages may be adapted to any suitable turninglathe. 1 i What we claim as our invention, and wish to secure by Letters Patent'is- Y vThe manner of fixing, and adjusting .the guide strips, andof combining with them the parts which'we have called the jack, and theA cat with their appendages, constructed and operating substantially in the manner a described.

In front of the revolving disk I make a fixture of any suitable material preferring it to be in the form of a perforated plate of cast-iron extending across the whole diameter of the disk, and reaching up to its center, the upper edge of the piece serving to receive one of the gudgeons of the disk. This fixture or plate stands at such distance from the disk as to allow the feeding in the ears between them, and partitions project from it so as to come nearly into con tact with the teeth, these partitions forming two, three or any convenient number of troughs in which the ears are received, and in passing through which they are shelled,- a steel spring forms the back of each of these troughs being attached by the upper"

To all whom it may concern Be it known that we, NEAL HALL, of Brunswick, in the county of Cumberland, and JOTHAM CHASE, of VVaterboro, in the county of York, and both of the State of Maine, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Modes of Fastening Shutters for Windows in Stores and Vother Buildings lVhere Security is Required, and that the following is a full and exact description of the same, reference being had to the annexed drawings of the same, making part of this specification. The bolt A, in Figure 1, which goes through the bar B, of the shutter is to be made in such a way that the socket or eye C, shall be in a vertical position, and that the key D, will enter this socket or eye perpendicularly, the key is to be longer than usual, and is to be attached by staples E, to the window frame of the building directly over the hole where the end of the bolt comes through, and is to be kept in a perpendicular direction by means of these staples, and made to play up, and down freely. There is to be a small stop, or shoulder F, on each side of that part of the key which lies between the staples so as to prevent the key dropping beyond the required depth. Underneath the key there is to be a spring Gr, which covers the hole where the end of the bolt comes through, and on the upper end of the spring there is a shoulder H, upon which the lower end of the key rests when the bolt is out of the hole, and the key is up, a small plate of iron may be nailed over the hole outside the building with a hole through the same of a shape, and size corresponding to the bolt which passes through it. The operation is as follows: l/Vhen 4the shutter is closed, and the bar put in its place, the bolt is put into the hole the ends of which strike against the steel springs which being pressed ofi', lets the key drop into the socket, or eye of the bolt, when the shutter is to be opened the key is raised, when the steel spring acts against the end of the bolt, and brings the shoulder (on the upper part of the steel spring) under the key and prevents its dropping down. The advantage gained is this: That one person can close, and fasten the shutters, and after they are closed it presents increased obstacles to persons entering from without.

To all whom t may concern.' Be it known that I, CONRAD KILE, of the city of Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Looms for Weaving Cloth for Stocks, (for which loom I obtained Letters Patent of the United States, dated September 18th, 1835 g) and I do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. My improvement upon the loom above named consists principally in the means by which I adapt the common straight lathe to the concave breast beamused by me. For this purpose the breast, or strain beam is cut off, or made straight on that side which is toward the lathe, and is also on that side hollowed out lengthwise, so as to admit the lower rail, or piece of the frame of the lathe to pass within it,V thereby allowing the reed to come lin contact, or nearly so with the breast beam, at every beat thereof. The upper part, and that portion of the fixed breast beam, which is toward the workman over which the yarn or chain passes is hollowed out for the purpose fully set forth, and described in my former specification. At every beat the lathe passes up to the same point, the woven material being received on the cloth be'am to an extent equal to that occupied by the bristle or other filling against which it strikes. Cn one end of the hollowed cloth beam there is a wheel or pulley around which a cord passes having a weight attached to it to operate the cloth beam as it receives the cloth, this wheel, or pulley is also furnished with a ratchet wheel and pawl to admit of the weight being wound up when necessary without disturbing the cloth beam. A wheel, or pulley similarly constructed are applied to the yarn beam by which the proper degree of strain is given thereto while the web is allowed to move forward readily at every beat of the lathe. The yarn beam may be of any length which may be preferred taking care to make the concavity 1n it, and my cloth beam such as shall adapt them to the curvature which I wish to give to Vthe woven material. VVit-h my improved loom I can use such bobbins, lathe, and shutters as in ordinary use, either using them by hand, or operating them by power as- I may see lit. As regards the curvature given to the hollow ofthe yarn, and cloth beams I now lind the girth of the middle of them should be about one fourth less than that of the ends, the curvature of the breast beam bec no part of which isintended to be claimed in this specilication. 3. And I further claim the use of a loom constructed upon the principle set forth to the weaving of a variety of other articles to which a bias is given by having the chain longer in one part than in another, such for example as stock stifteners, jackets, corsets or parts thereof.

To all whom it may concern Be it known that I, JORDAN L. MOTT, of the city of New York, and State of New York, have invented an Improvement, in Stoves, and also in Fireplaces with Open Grates, which improvement consists in an alteration made in the manner of forming the rings which constitute the shell or exterior of the furnace or fireplace for various kinds, as described, and claimed by me in the specifications annexed to Letters Patent granted to me and bearing date July 21, 1835, and also in the application of segments or portions of such rings to form the backs and sides of open grates or fireplaces, or such other parts or portions thereof other than the open bars-as are to contain the fuel, whether it be the back, sides, or bottom, which must in all cases be determined by the form given to such grate or fireplaces. In Figure 1, in the accompanying drawing the improved rings are represented as applied to a stove the furnace part A, is circular, these rings are superimposed upon each other as described in the specifications of the patent above alluded to, but the exterior of each ring, instead of forming a continuous hoop, or circle is indented, and presents an uneven serrated surface, usually cut into the ornamental form of leaves. The reason for giving this form to the rings, or segments of rings is to obviatea difficulty which has been found to exist in the continuous ring, namely its liability to crack, from a sudden increase of temperature within the furnace, and the consequent expanding of the inside of the ring more rapidly than the heat could be conducted through it to expand the exterior. The ring may be simply scalloped, or notched as shown in the plan, Fig. 2, the ornament bemg merely a thing of fancy, or taste. Fig. 3, represents a stove or fireplace of a kind for which I have also obtained Letters Patscalloped, or ornamented rings which are combined together to the requisite height their ends being attached to the jamb plates or other convenient part of the fireplace by rods, screws, or otherwise. l Jhat I claim as constituting the improvement for which I now ask Letters Patent,. The making of such scallops, or indentations as are herein described, in the rings which are used to constitute the shell of a furnace, stove, retort, or other apparatus in which fuel is to be burnt, or in [using the sections of such rings, or other formed figures to constitute the back, sides, or bottoms of fireplaces which are open on one or more sides, these claims being made irrespective of the position of such ring, or segments of rings, as the position must be determined by the particular construction, and use of the apparatus in which they are employed.

To all whom it may concern: Be it known that I, JAMES MURRAY, of the city of Baltimore and State of Maryland, have invented a new and useful lmprovement in Sawmills by the Application of an Endless-Slide-Chain Carriage, which is described as follows, reference being had to the annexed drawings of the same, making part of this specification. The distinguishing feature of this improvement consists in making use of an endless chain carriage having a continual motion for conveying the logs to the saws as well as conveying away the boards, instead of the common sliding carriage, which Yrequires to be stopped and drawn back every time a cut has been made to receive a new log. The main part of the sawmill frame is made similar to those of the best construction in use. In the improvement each link of the chains consists of three pieces, namely, the link A, the coupling or strop band the pin C. The link is made in the manner represented in the drawing with an acute angled or V notch, or other formed groove on the under side for sliding over the way D, which is formed of a corresponding shape on its upper edge to lit thereon. Projections E, are likewise formed on the sides of the link of the chain to allow the pincers F, to lay hold of the same, for securing the clamps which embrace the log, and hold it fast. The strap is made with an eye at each end, through which, and corresponding eyes in the cars pass the pins for connecting the cars, and strap together; the pins are made round to fit the holes just mentioned. There are two chains G, H, forming the two sides of the carriage placed parallel with each other at a suflicient distance apart accordingv to the width of carriage required. They pass around polygonal wheels z', placed horizontally at a suitable distance apart determined by the length of the carriage. The parts of the chains which support the log move over permanent ways D, made in the manner before described xed on the frame. The log is secured to the chains byv means of clamps, each clamp consisting of a transom Figure K, placed across the chains, upon which the log is laid. A beam L, is placed upon the log over the transom just mentioned connected at the ends of the pincers F, which lock underthe projections of the chains before described. There may be any required number of these clamps which are required to be removed constantly by the attendant, as the log advances, and replaced in the rear of the saws. The polygonal wheels at each end over which the chains pass, being necessarily larger than the pinion on the common sawmill the speed must be regulated by suitable gearing. The log may also be secured upon the carriage by binders in the usual manner with the addition of braces M, to prevent the log from rising. An additional set of saws, and carriage may be used for cutting a log into any number of pieces, and after these pieces are cut, they may be turned down on another carriage and cut into laths, flooring, or other stuff from half an inch to any requisite thickness. By the use of this carriage but little time is wasted in sawing as one log may be placed against the end of the preceding one, and the saws kept constantly going, whereas in the common gang sawmill, the saws will be idle while the boards are taken off and the carriage is backed to receive another log. Another advantage in the use of an endless carriage is that it will discharge'the lumber out of the mill without manual labor. The gangs of saws and endless carriages may be so arranged that the timber from one carriage, when sawn shall pass directly upon ano-ther carriage, or otherwise. The invention claimed and desired to be secured by Letters Patent consists in- The application of an endless slide chain or chains forming a continual moving carriage, upon which the timber is sawed, and the boards, etc., are conveyed out of the mills. n JAMES MURRAY.

To all whom it may concern: Be it known that I, SAMUEL GLIME, of Bucks county, Pennsylvania, have invented a combined plow, being a machine for plowing in light free soil, for plowing in grain, dressing Indian corn, and all other light work of similar kind. The principle of combination on which the due construction of the machine depends is to place the line of draft, or beam so that the resistance to be overcome may bear equally on each side of that line. To effect this purpose the transverse-beam or rest to which the several plows are attached is fastened to the beam precisely in the middle of the transverse beam, and having the center plow immediately under the point of intersection. The other plows are then placed equidistant on each side of the beam. This disposition brings the beam of the plow very nearly in the line of equal resistance, the middle plow becomes a center of motion, or fulcrum in which the whole machine balances, and adds greatly to the strength of the apparatus, and the firmness of its parts. The transverse beams cross the beam of the plow at an angle offorty five degrees thus placing the right hand plow as much before the next succeeding one as it is removed at a right angle on one side and thereby giving the greatest possible room, or space w1th the least length of beam. For the same reason the length of the sole of the plow should not much exceed its extreme breadth. The proportions used, and found convenient, are about ten inches in length by eight in breadth, and the turn of the mold board should be very little beyond a perpendicular from the hinder corner of the share. The plows consist simply of a mouldboard, landside, and sheath, or standard. The mold board is drawn, flattened out at the lower edge so as to supply the place of a share, or wing. These should all be of iron either hammered, and rolled, or cast at the pleasure of the maker, and fastenedinto the transverse beam by the standard with a shoulder on the under side of the beam fitted to an iron collar, or codrill, and a screw or nut or strong wedge on the top of the beam. The standards are made one foot in height, and the draft, or depth of the plow is given by elevating the forward end of the beam about one inch the whole length of the beam being five feet. The hinder end of the beam is fastened in a piece of timber crossing it at right angleshorizontally, and meeting a similar piece oftimber laid parallel with the bearrnand both of them fastened in the transverse beam. so as to brace the Whole framework, and to form a rest for the stilts, or handles of the-plow. The machine is found to work well with plows of eight inches in breadth placed at the distance offourteen inches from each other, thus cutting. about ten inches each, and using five plows. Two horses are able. to work this combined plow quite easily, and to pass over as much land in a day as three, teams of two horses each with a common single plow. To construct a combined plow, draw a i right line A, B, for the beam about five feet in length. Draw another. line C,-D, for the transverse beam at an angle of forty five degrees with the former cutting at A, B, at a convenient distance from the hinder end, say fifteen inches, and carry C, D, with the right end forward to equal distances on each side of A, B, making the whole length of C, D, for five plows, say four feet eight inches, for three plows two feet four inches,- through it at each end, or one inch at each side of each standard. v SAMUEL CLIME.

My improvement in the art or method of managing the fire in the furnaces of locomotive engines consists simply making the fire in the furnace, fire-place, or grate which may be detached from, and appended to the boiler at pleasure. The intention of this new mode of managing the fire is to enable me, at each water station, or in any convenient place to have a clear coal fire waiting the arrival of the engine so that the grate or fire-place which has been in use, may be detached or slid out, and that containing the clear fire, made to occupy its place. obvious that they will at once present themselves to any competent engineer. The fire while burning may be placed under the reservoir from which the tender is to be supplied, thus rendering the heat generated 7 available, giving a supply of hot water from that portion which would otherwise be wasted. The grate containing the fire may be placed on a small car, or on a long lever sunk below the railroad, and so arranged as to transfer it readily. All that I claim as my invention, is The preparing a fire in a grate which may be transferred from the place where itis made to the proper place under the boiler of a locomotive steam engine for the generating of steam as hereinbefore set forth.

The nature of my invention consists in the use of a plate similar tothe common plates, of metal, or other substance. If metal be used I cut a hole through the plate on a circle, or in a line perpendicular, or otherwise, between this plate, and the door is introduced a circle, or slide, one side, or one end whereof is shown through hole in the. which moves the circle passes through the door, and has a hand or index to show when the front circle or slide is right, or the circle or slide may be moved by a key through the front plate when no hand or index would be needed, a spring or catch may be used to hold the circle or slide in its intended position. The front plate as well as the circle, and slide may be made to exhibit the name, &c., in type or it may be engraved or the impression may be stamped, each circle or slide may be so constructed, that it will exhibit nothing more than is seen on a common doorplate. If the front plate is transparent darken all parts of the plate except where you wish the circles or slides to be shown through. If several circles placed side by side, be used, there must be as many transparent places, as circles or slides, but if they are placed one before the other only one transparent place is needed, if a circle be used the edge may be made thick, and revolve against the holes. The plates may be placed on doors or elsewhere as required.

Specification of Letters Patent No. 57', dated October 19', 1836. To all who/m, it may concern Be it known that I, SAMUEL COUILLARD, Jr., of Boston, in the county of Suffolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, machinist, have invented, made, constructed, and applied to use a new and useful improvement in the art of combining and separating the fibers of flax, hemp, and Manila grass and forming the same into roving, which specify as follows-that is' to say, for the explanation and understanding of my said invention and improvement reference is to be had to the drawings and plans hereto annexed, which are t'o be taken and considered as a part of this my specification. v Plate numbered one, is ak front view of the machine, plate numbered two,ris a back view of the same machine, plate numbered three, is a side view'of the same machine, and plate numbered four, is a vertical view of the same machine. The plans are drawn on a scale of two inches to the foot, and are intended to indicate the diderent sizes, and proportions of the different parts of the machine which are deemed best for operating with it upon the fibers of ordinary length to the greatest advantage. The roman letter A, in the several plates indicates those parts, which belong to the frame of the machine. B, designates what is denominated by me the fringe table on which the fibers hanging from the teeth in the fringe belt hereinafter mentioned in the form of a fringe rest, while the wipers act upon them. The letter a, on plates l and 2, respectively indicates the drawing pulley to the main shaft indicated by on plates l, 2 and 3. C, on plate 2, indicates kan endless screw upon the main shaft which acts on the pinion CZ, Plate l, which pinion moves horizontally with a vertical shaft, Plates l, and 2, turning in boxes, and connected with a fixed pulley at its upper end, which pulley revolves horizontally with the shaft, and gives motion to an endless belt z, Plates 1, 2, and 3, which I denominate the fringe belt, which belt passes around another pulley f, Plate et, at the opposite side of the frame of the same size with itself, and on the same level, and moving horizontally by the friction of the belt. In this belt pointed steel, or metallic teeth, steelis preferable, are set or fixed vertically of such size, and at such distances from each other as the quality of the fiber to becombed may in the discretion of the operator require. For ax the fibers of which are of ordinary length, I prefer that they should be about 'oneeighth of an inch in diameter at the lower end, and taper to a point in the form of a common tailors needle, and be about one and a half inches above the edge of the belt a, and about one-fourth of an inch apart from each other; and for hemp, or Manila grass' thel said teeth should be about one-third larger, and about three-eighths of an inch from each other. The dimensions first above mentioned however will serve even for hemp and Manila grass, but larger teeth are deemed vbetter in this case when the fibers are brittle. Different belts with teeth of different sizes to be changed one for the other according to the different kind of fibers to be operated upon may be used with advantage. This belt e, consists of two thicknesses of stout harness leather, between are inserted, and are held Vthereby the leather being glued together between them. This is deemed the most convenient, and best way of making the fringe belt withv teeth, but the belt as it is obvious may be made of various other materials, and the teeth may be secured therein by various means which it is deemed unnecessary to describe. Beyond the frame at the opposite end upon the main shaft near its end is fixed a pulley around which a belt z', plates 3, and 4, passes which gives motion to another pulley c, plates 3, and t, fixed to the shaft of the large cylinder which I denominate the combining cylinder designated by Z, in each plate, this cylinder Z, moves vertically, and its Lipper surface moves down toward the revolving belt a, with teeth in it aforesaid when the machine is in operation, upon-,the cylinder are set steel, or metal straight teeth in rows in a right line with its shaft quitev across the cylinder in pieces of wood introduced by m, in all the plates, extendingv across the cylinder, and attached to it; from, and above which pieces of wood the teeth project about one half of an inch upward, these teeth are to be about the same lsize as those in the revolving belt e, and about the vsame distance apart from each other having regard always to the length of.: the fibers to be operated upon as before mentioned. There should be about six of those rows of ico upright teeth, being about a foot, and 'a half from each other upon a cylinder of three feet in diameter for flax, but the diameter of the cylinder may advantageously be larger, and the rows of upright teeth farther apart for longer fibers, although the above specified dimensions will answer for hemp, and Manila grass of ordinary length. And in all cases the diameter of the cylinder, and distance of these teeth from each other should be adapted to the length of the fiber to be Aoperated upon, and the roving to. be produced. For combining fiax or hemp for fine thread these teeth should be fixed gradually lnearer together from the outer end. of the cylinder Z, where they should be farthest apart to the inner end where they should be nearest together, so as to have them about three eighths of an inch at one end, and one eighth of an Vinch at the other, in order that the fibers after they are lodged upon the revolving belt z, as `they pass along by the cylinder Z, may be first combed by the teeth on the cylinder which are farthest apart, and that the teeth nearer together may act upon the fibers on said belt upon which the coarser teeth have already acted. By this means the longer fibers are more easily separated from the shorter fibers, and the fibers connected together are more eectually split, and separated from each other, and made more even, and equal in size. But in combining hemp, and other like fibraceous substances for rope yarn, and such like purposes it is better to have these teeth farther apart from each other so that the fibers may not be so much cut up 0r broken. These teeth may be fixed in the cylinder Z, instead of being fixed in such pieces of wood to be attached to the cylinder, but it is more convenient to have them fixed in such pieces of wood in order that they may whenever occasion may re-v quire it, be removed with the pieces of wood from the cylinder, with pleasure, and other teeth nearer together, or farther apart be placed in their stead according to the length, and kind of fiber to be operated upon, and the kind of roving intended to be made. n, plates 2, 3, 4, indicates a wire brush, or small wire teeth xed on leather, and attached to a piece of wood extending across the cylinder Z, close to the pieces of wood upon which the straight, and upright teeth aforesaid are fixed, the inner end of these pieces of wood, on which the brushes are, projects about two inches beyond the cylinder Z, so as in its revolution to come in contact with, and be operated upon by a comb. The teeth of these brushes are about the same size as ordinary card teeth, and are xed in the leather in the same way, but the teeth are bent to an angle of forty five degrees opposite to the directions of the motion of the cylinder Z. The number of these brushes on pieces of wood is equal to the number of rows of upright large teeth near which they are respectively placed. The surfaces, or tops of these brushes are, excepting when acted upon, and moved up by the comb-as hereinafter mentioned on a level with the top of the pieces of wood in which the rows of the upright teeth are placed. The pieces of wood to which these brushes are attached have slots made diagonally one near each end through which pass screws, or pins with heads fixed in the other pieces of wood in which are the upright teeth so that when the projecting ends 0, plates l, 2, 4, pass by the stationary comb, 29, plates l, 4, each brush is when acted upon by this combthereby raised a vlittle above the top .of the upright teeth aforesaid, and so remains until it passes down by, and near to the points of the teeth on the endless belt e, when having passed the comb it returns to its former position being drawn down by means of a spring g, plates 2, 4. The points of the upright teeth, and surface of the cards pass as near as may be and not touch to the teeth on the revolving fringe belt e, so as to lodge the fibers upon its teeth, and comb them when lodged there. Those which are not lodged at first. pass around the cylinder, and are lodged afterward. Underneath the combing cylinder is a curved piece of metal, or wood 7c3, plate 3, forming the same curve described by the points of the fixed teeth in revolving, and being as near as may be, but not quite in contact with them of the width of the frame, and covering nearly the lower half of the cylinder for preventing the fibers from falling out of the teeth when they come underneath by the revolution of the cylinder. The pulley indicated by t, on all the plates fixed on the outer end of the main shaft b, by means of a belt passing over it, and the pulley s, on all the plates fixed upon the end of the shaft t, plates 2, 3, 4 of a metallic fluted draw roller gives motion to that roller which turns in boxes fixed in parts of the frame. Immediately above the fiuted roller is another roller covered with .leather so adjusted to the fiuted roller as to press closely upon, and be turned by it when it revolves. Inside of the pulley s, upon the shaft t, is fixed a small pinion which acts upon a wheel u, Plate 3, upon the inside of which is another pinion acting upon a pinion fixed to the pulley Q1, Plates 3 and 4, from which a belt passes over the pulley w, Plates 8 and 4. This gearing is only used when it is required to produce a slow motion in the pulley fw, and in ordinary cases a belt passing from the shaft t, to the pulley fw, is substitutedV for it in order to give motion to the pulley fw. The pulley fw, is fixed upon the shaft y, Plates 3, and 4, of a cylindrical roller inside the frame over whichv passes a feedin belt of leather indicated by a, Plate 4, w ich also passes over another cylinder roller of the same size, and on the same level inside of the frame, turned by the friction of the feeding belt operated upon by the motion of 4the other roller, and near to theliuted rollers aboye mentioned. Across this belt about two inches apart there should be rows of teeth, of about the same size as those in the endless fringe belt a, and about half an inch from each other. The teeth may be fixed in this belt, or which is better in pieces of wood attached to it, so that they may be changed for others larger, orv smaller, and further apart, or nearer together so as to be adapted to the kind of fibers to be ojo-'Y The cylinders over which erated upon. this endless feeding belt a, passes are so placed that the feeding belt in revolving brings the center of the teeth between the points, and the bottoms thereof successively level with the upper surface of the iluted draw roller, and so that these teeth may just pass by the same fiuted roller as near as may be, and not touch it. The points of these teeth should be bent on a curve a little backward from the draw rollers. The upper surface of the Vfeeding` belt when the machine is in motion is moved by the act-ion of the belt on the pulley w, toward the fluted draw roller. Rod cylinders as I denominate them indicated by a2, Plates 2, 3, and 4, fixed to shafts, and revolving in boxes in the frame, are so placed above the feeding belt, and adjusted as to be moved by the teeth set in rows as aforesaid across the belt by means of the rows of teeth successively meshing in between the rods, while the belt is revolving; these rod cylinders serve to keep the fibrous substance to be operated upon from rising out of the teeth too soon while drawn by the teeth toward the draw rollers. Large wires, or rods o-n one side of the revolving feeding belt are laid between the teeth, and are fixed at one end on the frame, and at the other on the iluted draw roller for the purpose of conducting the. ends of the fibers gradually up as on an inclined plane from the teeth to t-he draw rollers. A brush Z22, Plates 3, and 4, is moved by a belt from a groove on the inside of the pulley w, to keep the covered upper draw roller from being clogged byv the fibrous substance. A pulley (Z2, Plates 1 and 2, is fixed on the main shaft b, next to the endless screw over which a belt passes to, and over, and gives motion to a pulley 02, Plates 1 and 2, upon a perpendicular shaft f2, Plate 2, on the upper end of which is the first draw roller a2, Plate 4, against which the draw roller h2, Plate 4, is pressed by a spring over a pulley onk the main shaft next that last mentioned passes a belt, which also passes over, and gives motion to the pulley e2, fixed on the `perpendicular shaft of the second draw roller 7a2, Plate 4, which has a like vroller o2, Plates 8, 4,' pressed against by a spring. On the shaft of the second draw ,roller below the pulley before mentioned is fixed another pulley m2, Plate 1, over which passes a belt to, and over, and gives'motiontoa pulley n2, fixed on a perpendicularv shaft 02 Plate 1, which shaft passes 'up to a pulley ,'02, Plates 1, 2,'and 4, fixed -supon it. A belt g, Plates 1, 2, and 4, passes around, and is moved by this pulley, and passes around, and gives motion to another pulley rz, Plates 1, 2, and 4, somewhat smaller than that last mentioned, and of the same size with the pulleys around which the teethed fringed belt a, passes. On thisbelt ,92, are fixed steel, or metallic wires s2, Plates 1, v2, 3, and 4, (steel kbeing preferred) for the purpose of bringing the fibers into such position, while passing along the fringe table -lodged in the teeth of the fringe belt a, as to direct the ends of them forward toward the draw rollers, that they may be seized, and drawn out by these rollers. A plate of iron is put upon the frame above the place where the brous substance is made to pass when it approaches near to the draw rollers having slots wz, co2, Plate 4, through which the wipers pass for the purpose of directing the ends of the fibers just before coming to the rollers, and so made, and adjustedfas that the wipers may be raised by, and pass over the metallic plate, and be thereby prevented from acting upon the fibers just at the time when the fibers come to the draw rollers so as to prevent their crushing Lthe fibers from the draw rollers. Inclined planes of thin smooth metal o2, Plates 1, and 4, one on each side of the teeth, beginning at the base of the teeth therein near the last draw roller, and inclining upward in the direction of the mof tion vof the belt until they rise above the teeth in the toot-hed revolving fringe belt, and fixed so as to take off the short fibers, or tow not taken off by the draw rollers, and remaining on these teeth. OnV the main shaft is another pulley m2, Plates 1, and 3, next to the frame on the inside over which a belt passes to give motion to the shaft 002, Plates 1, and 3. Upon the opposite end of this shaft beyond the frame is a pulley z2, Plate 1. Upon this shaft over which a belt as, Plates 1, and 4,- pa'sses to, and over, and gives mot-ion to the pulleys b3, Plates 1, and 4,r to give motion to the leading roller 03, Plates 1, and 4, to draw, and bring the roving through the revolving tubes. Two rollers d3, Plates 1, and 4, are adjusted to bear upon this leading roller, and to revolve by its friction for the purpose of drawing and leading the roving through, and from the revolving tubes into the can. On Vthe opposite end of the shaft wz, is a pulley e3, Plates 1 and 3, over which a belt passes to give motion to the pulley f3, Plates l, 3, and 4, which gives motion to a like leading roller g3, Plates l, and 4, which has two rollers h3, Plates l and t, for a like purposeof drawing, leading, and conducting the second roving into the can. 3, 3, are revolving tubes with hooks for the purpose of condensing the roving into a more compact form, which revolving tubes are moved by belts over the pulleys 703, 3, Plate l, on the shaft m2. Y When the machine is put in motion, and adapted to the particular fibrous substance to be operated upon, the fibrous substance may either be laid on the feeding belt by hand, or may be more conveniently formed into a bat, and wound upon a reel, and fed from that upon the leather belt upon the wires, or rods c2, occupying about one third of its width in ordinary cases. The width of the belt is calculated for receiving the fibrous substance on the whole width of it, when it is intended to make coarse threads for bag yarn, and similar sizes, in which case the rods must be laid as aforesaid over the whole width of the belt. The fibrous substance when fed upon the belt, while the machine is in motion first comes in contact with the teeth in the feeding belt, and these fibers are carried along under the rod cylinders moved by the teeth which serve to keep them down as aforesaid, and thence they are carried along the rods, and up between the draw rollers which serve to draw them from the teeth in the pieces of wood on the feeding belt in a thinner form, and conduct vthem to the combing cylinder Z, by which they are received, and carried along in the fixed teeth on said cylinder which in revolving carries them down and fromv time to time lodges them on the teeth o-f the revolving fringe belt e, Yafter they have been raised by the card teeth in manner aforesaid to the bevel of the points of the fixed teeth on the said cylinder Z, and when the fibers are on the teeth of the fringe belt they are combed as aforesaid as they pass along by the cylinder e. Having passed by the cylinder they are carried along, hooked on the teeth of the revolving belt z, hanging down, and appearing like a fringe, and are wiped by the wipers s2, on the revolving belt 92, so as to present the ends of the fibers foremost, and bring them within the reach of the draw rollers for drawing out the roving 22 L2,2, Z2, ' the wipers being raised from the fringe table vsuccessively by the metallic plate under which the fibers pass just before the wipers reach the draw rollers so that the wipers may not brush away the bers from the draw rollers. The draw rollers are placed at different distances from the revolving fringe belt e. The first being farthest, and the other or others if it be thought proper to have mcrerthan two sets of draw rollers being placed successively nearer to said belt, so that the longest fibers may be t-aken into the rst draw rollers farthest fromrsaid belt, and the shorter remaining fibers which do not reach the first drawer rollers, into the neXt draw rollers, and the still shorter fibers which do not reach the latter, into the neXt draw rollers, if more than two sets are used. Each set of draw rollers takes all the fibers which reach them. As many sets of draw rollers may be used for this purpose as occasion may require. From the draw rollers e2, 71.2, 7c3, Z2 the fibers are conducted through the revolving 3, 3, into the cans. The short fibers, and those entangled are carried to the inclined metallic planes, and thereby taken from the teeth on the belt which are thus cleared, and pass around the cylinder Z, to receive more fibers therefrom to be combed, and brought around in manner aforesaid to the draw rollers to be formed into roving. It will be well to have each set of draw rollers after the first set, successively smaller than the first set, or if of the same size to have them revolve slower as they are respectively nearer to the fringe belt, in order to make the roving as near as may be of the same size. What I claim as my new improvement is l. The combing cylinder above described in connection with the revolving toothed fringed belt aforesaid for the purposes herein before mentioned. 2. The inclined planes on both the sides of revolving toothed fringe belt in connection, and combination with said fringe belt for the purpose aforesaid. In testimony that the above is a true specification of my said invention, and improvement, I have hereto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred, and thirty-six.
