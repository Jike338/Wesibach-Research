and
three

(
3
mono-layers
)
of
aluminum

is
set
to
be
several

.
Then
the
above
formation
process
of
the
one
layer
(
1
mono-layer
)
of
hafnium
oxide
and
three
layers
of
aluminum
oxide
is
repeatedly
performed
.
By
these
operations
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
made
of
amorphous
hafnium
aliminate
having
a
specified
composition
ratio
is
formed
when
viewed
macroscopically
.
Moreover
in
the
embodiment
a
film
thickness
of
the
upper
layer
insulating
film
18
is
about
one
third
or
more
of
that
of
the
lower

.
Next
a
gate
electrode
made
of
for
example
polycrystalline
silicon
is
deposited
on
the
upper

gate
insulating

.
That
is
as
shown
in

made
of
polycrystalline
silicon
(
p-Si
)
having
a
film
thickness
of
for

50

is
deposited
on
the
upper

by
using
a
CVD
(

method
.
Next
as

in
FIG
.
4A
a
gate
electrode

is
formed
by
performing
patterning
operations
using
photolithography
and
etching
technology
.
As
shown
in
FIG

a
hafnium
concentration
Nh
is
set
to
be
for
example
75
%
in
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
that
is
in
a
region
with
a
distance
d
from
an
interface
of
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
on
a
side
of
the
substrate
being
within
a
range
of
(
0dda
)
and
to
be
for
example
25
%
in
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
that
is
in
a
region
with
a
distance
d
from
an
interface
of
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
on
a
side
of
the
substrate
being
within
a
range
of
(
daddg
)
and
is
set
so
as
to
be
discontinuously
change
at
a
boundary
region
(
d=da
)
.
Here
da
represents
a
thickness
of
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
and
dg
represents
a
total
thickness
of
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
and
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
.
In
this
case
an
aluminum
concentration
Na
is
set
to
be
25
%
in
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
and
to
be
75
%
in
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
and
a
relation
of
[
Na
[
%
]
=100Nh
]
is
maintained
.
Then
after
specified
impurities
have
been
implanted
into
the
silicon
substrate
3
by
using
the
gate
electrode
6
as
a
mask
an
annealing
process
is
performed
at
a
temperature
of
for
example
1000
C.
to
form
the
source-drain
region
2
as
shown
in
FIG
.
4B
.
Here
during
the
heat
treatment
in
the
process
of
the
source-drain
region
formation
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
the
boundary
between
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
and
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
the
change
in
the
concentration
of
hafnium
or
aluminum
becomes
mild
due
to
thermal
diffusion
as
a
result
causing
the
boundary
to
disappear
and
the
single
layer
gate
insulating
film
5
to
be
formed
.
Thus
the
FET
1
as
shown
in
FIG
.
1
is
obtained
.
Next
a
characteristic
in
the
region
in
the
obtained
FET
1
where
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
formed
is
described
by
referring
to
FIG
.
1
and
FIG
.
9
.
Especially
in
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
shown
in
FIG
.
1
since
the
region
is
positioned
immediately
below
the
gate
electrode
6
the
concentration
of
aluminum
is
set
to
be
comparatively
high
.
This
enables
prevention
of
degradation
of
the
EOT
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
caused
by
use
of
polycrystalline
silicon
(
polycrystalline
semiconductor
)
as
the
material
for
the
gate
electrode
6
and
by
use
of
only
hafnium
oxide
as
the
material
for
the
gate
insulating
film
5
and
thus
enables
suppression
of
lowering
in
electrostatic
capacitance
which
serves
to
reduce
leakage
currents
.
Moreover
since
the
gate
insulating
film
5
contains
a
specified
concentration
of
hafnium
lowering
of
a
dielectric
constant
of
the
entire
gate
insulating
film
5
is
suppressed
which
serves
to
ensure
a
required
EOT
.
Also
since
in
the
region
5
a
on
the
lower
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
is
set
to
be
relatively
high
lowering
in
the
dielectric
constant
of
the
entire
gate
insulating
film
5
is
suppressed
thus
serving
to
ensure
the
required
EOT
and
at
the
same
time
since
a
specified
concentration
of
aluminum
is
contained
crystallization
of
hafnium
oxide
can
be
prevented
.
Therefore
occurrence
of
a
grain
boundary
passing
through
the
gate
insulating
film
5
can
be
suppressed
thus
serving
to
prevent
an
increase
in
leakage
currents
.
Moreover
an
investigation
of
a
relation
between
the
EOT
and
leakage
current
density
made
to
evaluate
a
characteristic
of
the
FET
1
shows
good
results
as
shown
in
FIG
.
9
.
In
FIG
.
9
a
characteristic
curve
L1
shows
a
relation
between
the
EOT
and
the
leakage
current
density
in
the
FET
1
of
the
embodiment
.
Also
a
characteristic
curve
La
shows
a
relation
between
the
EOT
and
the
leakage
current
density
obtained
when
metals
are
used
as
the
material
for
the
gate
electrode
6
and
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
up
of
only
hafnium
oxide
.
Furthermore
characteristic
curves
Lb
Lc
and
Ld
show
relations
between
the
EOT
and
the
leakage
current
density
obtained
when
polycrystalline
silicon
is
used
as
the
material
for
the
gate
electrode
6
and
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
up
of
only
hafnium
oxide
only
aluminum
oxide
and
only
silicon
oxide
respectively
.
As
shown
in
FIG
.
9
in
the
case
of
the
FET
1
of
the
embodiment
the
EOT
is
greatly
reduced
when
compared
with
the
case
where
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
up
of
only
hafnium
oxide
and
its
characteristic
comes
near
to
that
obtained
when
metals
are
used
as
the
material
for
the
gate
electrode
6
and
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
up
of
only
hafnium
oxide
.
Thus
according
to
the
configurations
of
the
FET
of
the
embodiment
since
in
the
region
5
a
on
the
lower
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
whose
thickness
occupies
about
three
fourths
of
all
thickness
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
the
concentration
of
hafnium
being
a
material
having
a
high
dielectric
constant
is
made
comparatively
high
and
since
also
in
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
hafnium
is
contained
in
a
specified
concentration
it
is
possible
to
suppress
lowering
of
the
dielectric
constant
of
the
entire
gate
insulating
film
5
and
to
ensure
the
required
EOT
.
Moreover
since
in
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
the
concentration
of
aluminum
is
made
comparatively
high
and
since
in
the
region
immediately
below
the
gate
electrode
6
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
is
made
particularly
high
when
polycrystalline
silicon
(
polycrystalline
semiconductor
)
is
used
as
the
material
for
the
gate
electrode
6
and
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
up
of
only
hafnium
oxide
it
is
possible
to
suppress
lowering
of
an
electrostatic
capacitance
that
is
to
prevent
degradation
of
the
EOT
and
to
reduce
leakage
currents
.
Also
not
only
in
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
but
also
in
the
region
5
a
on
the
lower
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
in
which
the
concentration
of
hafnium
is
set
to
be
relatively
high
aluminum
is
contained
in
a
specified
concentration
which
enables
crystallization
of
hafnium
oxide
to
be
suppressed
.
As
a
result
occurrence
of
a
grain
boundary
passing
through
the
gate
insulating
film
5
can
be
suppressed
and
an
increase
in
leakage
currents
can
be
prevented
.
This
enables
dielectric
breakdown
to
be
reduced
thus
improving
reliability
of
the
semiconductor
device
.
Also
since
crystallization
of
hafnium
oxide
can
be
suppressed
surface
roughness
can
be
improved
and
a
local
concentration
of
electric
fields
in
a
region
in
which
film
thickness
is
small
can
be
avoided
which
enables
leakage
currents
to
be
reduced
thus
improving
reliability
of
the
semiconductor
device
.
Moreover
by
providing
heat
treatment
after
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
has
been
deposited
on
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
and
hafnium
concentration
Nh
can
be
made
changeable
continuously
in
the
boundary
region
it
is
possible
to
prevent
such
a
problem
as
a
decrease
in
a
threshold
value
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
caused
by
trapped
electric
charges
in
the
boundary
region
.
Also
since
the
ALD
method
is
used
to
form
the
gate
insulating
film
5
improvement
of
film
quality
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
is
made
possible
by
precisely
controlling
concentrations
of
aluminum
and
hafnium
and
contamination
caused
by
carbon
contained
in
the
material
gas
can
be
prevented
by
introducing
the
purge
gas
.

The
FET
21
of
the
second
embodiment
differs
greatly
from
the
FET

employed
in
the
first
embodiment
in
that
in
the
first
embodiment
after
the

have
been
formed
concentrations
are
continuously
changed
at

c
in
a
process
of
heat
treatment
however
in
the
second
embodiment
after
a
plurality
of
intermediate
insulating
films
whose
hafnium
concentration
Nh
and
aluminum
concentration
Na
are
changed
in
stages
has
been
formed
between
a
lower
gate
insulating
film
and
an
upper
gate
insulating
film
and
a
heat
treatment
process
is
performed
.
Configurations
other
than
described
above
are
almost
the
same
as
those
in
the
first
embodiment
and
their
descriptions
are
made
simple
accordingly
.
The
FET
(
semiconductor
device
)
21
of
the
second
embodiment
as
shown
in
FIG

10
includes
a
silicon

26
made
of
for

on
the
gate

25
.
The
gate
insulating
film
25
has
a
specified
thickness
(
for
example
20
to
50
that
is
about
2
nm
to

)
and
is
so
formed
that
each

changes
along
a
direction
of
its
thickness
toward
the
gate
electrode
6
from
a
side
of
the
silicon
substrate
23
thus
causing
a
hafnium
concentration
Nh
to
monotonously
become
lower
and
an
aluminum
concentration
Na
to
monotonously
become
higher
.
Moreover

In

Next
a
method
for

First
as

a

24
made
of

is
formed
on
a

Then
a
lower

made
of
hafnium
aluminate
containing
a
specified

of
hafnium
and
aluminum
is
formed
on

the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
27
in
a
manner
that
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
becomes
lower
in
order
(
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
becomes
higher
in
order
)
.
Next
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
32
whose
hafnium
concentration
Nh
is
made
lower
than
that
of
the
third
intermediate
insulating
film
31
is
formed
on
the
third
intermediate
insulating
film
31
.
Then
an
electrode
layer
33
made
of
polycrystalline
silicon
is
formed
on
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
32
for
example
by
the
CVD
method
.
Then
as
shown
in
FIG
.
13B
a
gate
electrode
26
is
formed
by
performing
patterning
operations
using
photolithography
and
etching
technology
.
As
shown
in
FIG
.
14
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
is
set
to
be
for
example
75
%
in
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
27
that
is
in
a
region
with
a
distance
d
from
an
interface
of
the
gate
insulating
film
27
on
a
side
of
the
substrate
being
within
a
range
of
(
0ddb
)
and
to
be
for
example
25
%
in
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
32
that
is
in
a
region
with
a
distance
d
from
an
interface
of
the
gate
insulating
film
27
on
a
side
of
the
substrate
being
within
a
range
of
(
dfddg
)
and
is
set
to
be
a
specified
constant
value
so
as
to
become
lower
in
order
within
a
range
of
(
25
%
Nh75
%
)
in
each
of
the
first
intermediate
insulating
film
28
that
is
in
a
region
within
a
range
of
(
dbddc
)
the
second
intermediate
insulating
film
29
that
is
in
a
region
within
a
range
of
(
dcdde
)
and
the
third
intermediate
insulating
film
31
(
deddf
)
and
is
set
so
as
to
discontinuously
change
in
each
of
the
boundary
regions
(
d=db
dc
de
and
df
)
.
In
this
case
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
is
set
to
be
25
%
in
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
27
and
to
be
75
%
in
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
32
and
a
relation
of
Na
[
%
]
=100Nh
is
maintained
.
Then
after
specified
impurities
have
been
implanted
into
the
silicon
substrate
23
by
using
the
gate
electrode
26
as
a
mask
an
annealing
process
is
performed
to
form
a
source-drain
region
22
as
shown
in
FIG
.
13C
.
Here
during
the
heat
treatment
in
the
process
of
the
source-drain
region
formation
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
a
boundary
between
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
27
and
the
first
intermediate
insulating
film
28
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
a
boundary
between
the
first
intermediate
insulating
film
28
and
the
second
intermediate
insulating
film
29
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
a
boundary
between
the
second
intermediate
insulating
film
29
and
the
third
intermediate
insulating
film
31
and
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
the
third
intermediate
insulating
film
31
and
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
32
the
change
in
the
concentrations
of
hafnium
or
aluminum
becomes
mild
due
to
thermal
diffusion
causing
the
boundary
to
disappear
and
as
a
result
the
single
layer
gate
insulating
film
25
to
be
formed
.
Thus
the
FET
21
as
shown
in
FIG
.
10
is
obtained
.
According
to
the
second
embodiment
almost
the
same
effect
as
achieved
in
the
first
embodiment
described
above
can
be
obtained
.
Additionally
since
the
change
in
concentrations
in
the
boundary
region
is
made
more
mild
the
characteristic
can
be
more
improved
.
It
is
apparent
that
the
present
invention
is
not
limited
to
the
above
embodiments
but
may
be
changed
and
modified
without
departing
from
the
scope
and
spirit
of
the
invention
.
For
example
in
the
above
embodiments
the
gate
insulating
films
5
and
25
are
formed
by
the
ALD
method
however
instead
of
the
ALD
method
the
CVD
method
can
be
used
for
forming
the
gate
insulating
films
5
or
25
.
This
enables
a
throughput
(
processing
capability
)
to
be
improved
.
The
CVD
method
that
can
be
used
here
includes
for
example
an
atmospheric
CVD
method
a
reduced
pressure
CVD
method
a
plasma
enhanced
CVD
method
or
a
like
.
Moreover
the
gate
electrode
can
be
formed
as
a
multi-layer
structure
in
which
metals
layers
are
stacked
on
a
polycrystalline
layer
.
Polycrystalline
silicon-germanium
[
SiGe
]
instead
of
polycrystalline
silicon
can
be
used
as
a
material
for
the
gate
electrode
.
The
material
gas
that
can
be
used
when
the
gate
insulating
films
5
or
25
are
formed
by
the
ALD
method
includes
Hf
(
NMe2
)
4
[
tetrakis
(
dimethylamino
)
hafnium
]
Hf
(
NEt2
)
4
[
tetrakis
(
diethylamino
)
hafnium
]
Hf
(
NMeEt
)
4
[
tetrakis
(
methylethylamino
)
hafnium
]
Hf
(
t-Bu
)
4
[
tetra
t-butyl
hafnium
]
instead
of
HfCl4
[
hafnium
tetrachloride
]
.
Also
as
the
oxidizing
agent
instead
of
ozone
(
O3
)
oxygen
(
O2
)
or
water
(
H2O
)
may
be
used
.
The
formation
of
the
seed
layer
4
or
24
may
be
omitted
.
In
the
above
embodiments
by
the
thermal
treatment
in
the
process
of
forming
the
source-drain
region
the
concentration
of
hafnium
or
aluminum
is
changed
continuously
in
a
region
in
the
vicinity
of
the
boundary
between
the
lower
layer
gate
insulating
film
8
and
the
upper
layer
gate
insulating
film
18
.
However
to
make
continuous
the
change
in
the
concentration
of
hafnium
or
aluminum
a
thermal
treatment
in
a
process
of
forming
a
gate
electrode
may
be
used
or
a
thermal
treatment
process
to
make
mild
the
change
in
the
concentration
of
hafnium
or
aluminum
may
be
provided
separately
.
The
temperature
for
the
thermal
treatment
is
set
to
be
within
a
range
between
800
C.
or
more
and
1000
C.
or
less
.
Also
in
the
above
first
embodiment
the
boundary
region
5
c
is
formed
where
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
and
aluminum
concentration
Na
are
continuously
changed
along
a
thickness
direction
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
by
the
thermal
treatment
however
the
FET
of
the
present
invention
may
be
so
constructed
as
to
have
an
interface
instead
of
the
boundary
region
5
c.
Moreover
in
the
first
embodiment
each
of
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
and
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
is
constant
in
the
region
5
a
on
the
lower
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
and
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
however
the
present
invention
is
not
limited
to
this
that
is
the
FET
may
be
constructed
so
that
the
hafnium
concentration
Nh
becomes
lower
and
the
aluminum
concentration
Na
becomes
higher
in
these
regions
5
a
and
5
b
along
a
direction
from
a
side
of
the
substrate
to
a
side
of
the
gate
electrode
.
In
the
first
embodiment
the
thickness
of
the
region
5
a
on
the
lower
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
occupies
about
three
fourths
and
the
thickness
of
the
region
5
b
on
the
upper
layer
side
of
the
gate
insulating
film
5
occupies
about
one
fourth
however
the
present
invention
is
not
limited
to
this
that
is
a
ratio
of
the
thickness
of
the
upper
layer
region
5
b
may
be
made
higher
.
Furthermore
in
the
second
embodiment
the
three
layers
of
the
intermediate
insulating
films
each
having
a
different
hafnium
concentration
Nh
and
aluminum
concentration
Na
are
formed
however
the
present
invention
is
not
limited
to
this
that
is
two
layers
or
four
layers
or
more
of
the
intermediate
insulating
films
may
be
formed
.
